Tanjiro's attack completely severs Enmu's neck, causing the Lower Rank to unleash a terrible scream and break into pieces. The piece of the Demonic train that Tanjiro and Inosuke are on begins to fall sideways, with the former's earlier wound from the Train Engineer suddenly flaring with pain. Inosuke notes this with concern, but Tanjiro tells him to protect the passengers, his only concern living so that the train engineer doesn't become a murderer. The young Demon Slayer is cast a short distance from the inevitable train wreck, with Inosuke immediately attending to him.

Enmu dies
Enmu expires.

Tanjiro asks Inosuke to help the trapped and badly injured engineer, and after a mild argument, the latter agrees to do so. Tanjiro then attempts to stabilize his breathing, wanting to go help the injured passengers.A short distance away, what remains of Enmu notes with disbelief his body's continued disintegration, his lack of regeneration, and his entire scheme's failure.

The arrival
Something lands next to Tanjiro and Kyojuro.

He further notes the interference of Kyojuro Zenitsu, and Nezuko with frustration, but expresses the most anger towards Tanjiro and Inosuke, attempting to maneuver his crumbling body towards them. This ultimately failing, the Lower Rank laments his inability to ascend to the rank of Upper Rank, desperately wanting a redo as he finally expires.

Kyojuro compliments Tanjiro on being able to constantly perform Total Concentration Breathing, stating that he is one step closer to becoming a Hashira. He then notes the youth's injury, a collapsed blood vessel, and instructs him on how to stop the bleeding. Tanjiro puts all of his focus on stopping the hemorrhage, with support from his superior, and eventually succeeds. Kyojuro explains that if he masters his breathing, he will be able to do a multitude of things, and also informs the youth that all the passengers are safe. Without warning, something lands near the two, causing a large explosion.

The dust settles to reveal a tattooed Demon, who Tanjiro quickly realizes is Upper Rank Three of the Twelve Kizuki. The powerful foe swiftly attacks the prone Demon Slayer, but Kyojuro defends the youth and slices the offender's arm in twain with the Flame Breathing, Second Form: Rising Scorching Sun. The Demon retreats a short distance, the damaged arm quickly regenerating, and compliments Kyojuro's blade.

Akaza asks Kyojuro to become a Demon
The Upper Rank proposes Kyojuro become a Demon.

Kyojuro states he cannot understand why the Demon would attack a wounded person, the answer to which is that they would simply get in the pair's way. Kyojuro dismisses this, stating that despite this being their first meeting, he already hates the Upper Rank, a sentiment the Demon shares with weak humans. Kyojuro notes their different moral values, to which the Upper Rank offers a proposal: become a Demon like him. The prominent Demon Hunter quickly declined this, but the Upper Rank complimented his strength nevertheless, deducing him to be a Hashira.

Kyojuro introduces himself as the Flame Hashira, while the Upper Rank reveals his name to be Akaza. He goes on to say that Kyojuro will never cross into "supreme territory" because he is human, destined to grow old and die, and again proposes he become a Demon. Tanjiro notes that Akaza smells similarly to Muzan Kibutsuji and desperately searches for his sword to help Kyojuro. The Hashira explains that growing old and dying is the fleeting beauty of humanity and that their strength doesn't lie in the body. He states that Tanjiro isn't weak and shouldn't be insulted, repeats his earlier observation of their different moral values, and firmly declares that he will never become a Demon.

Compass Needle
Akaza readies an attack.

Akaza unleashes his Technique Development, Destructive Death: Compass Needle as he readies his fighting stance, declaring his intent to kill Kyojuro for his refusal, and the two clash. As Kyojuro uses the Flame Breathing, First Form: Unknowing Fire, Tanjiro is unable to follow their fight with his eyes, while elsewhere Inosuke senses the conflict. Akaza informs Kyojuro that all of the Hashira he had killed previously had refused his proposal and that he cannot understand their reasons for doing so. He tells the Hashira to die while he is still young and strong, and the two exchange attacks with the Flame Breathing, Fourth Form: Blooming Flame Undulation and Destructive Death: Air Type. Kyojuro quickly deduces the nature of Akaza's fighting style, deciding to close the distance to the Upper Rank.

Attack vs attack
Kyojuro and Akaza exchange a clash of techniques.

The Demon compliments Kyojuro's reaction speed, and the two exchange a flurry of blows. Akaza also compliments the Hashira's swordsmanship, stating that losing these skills would be sad, but Kyojuro denies this.

Tanjiro attempts to stand to assist his superior, but Kyojuro orders him not to move on account of his recent wounds. Akaza continues his assault on the Hashira, chiding him for paying attention to a weakling instead of focusing on the fight at hand. Inosuke arrives just in time to see the two exchange another clash of techniques with Kyojuro using the Flame Breathing, Fifth Form: Flame Tiger and Akaza using his Destructive Death: Disorder.
Tanjiro looks on with concern as Akaza tells an injured Kyojuro not to die, while Inosuke notes that he cannot assist the Hashira, as he can sense that he would only be in the way. Akaza warns Kyojuro of the futility of his attacks and points out the extent of his numerous injuries, while also noting that none of this would be an issue if he were a Demon.

Akaza impales Kyojuro
Kyojuro is impaled through the chest by Akaza

Tanjiro attempts to help his superior, but cannot due to the side effects of the Hinokami Kagura. Despite his injuries, Kyojuro's determination is unwavering as he prepares to unleash his ultimateattack Flame Breathing: Esoteric Art, Ninth Form: Rengoku, much to Akaza's delight. The Upper Rank responds with his own attack, Destructive Death: Annihilation Type, causing a large explosion. Tanjiro and Inosuke watch helplessly as the dust clears to reveal Kyojuro impaled through his solar plexus by Akaza's arm. The latter repeats his desire for the Flame Hashira to become a Demon, stating that he is one of the strong ones that has been chosen.

Kyojuro then has a flashback from his childhood, where his mother asked him why he was born stronger than other people. The young Kyojuro told her that he didn't know. She told him that it was to save the weak, that it was the obligation of anyone born strong to fulfill this duty, and to make sure he never forgot this, to which Kyojuro agreed. She then hugged her son, tearfully noting that she would not be alive for much longer, but that it was a blessing to be the mother of such a strong, gentle child.

Continued attack
Kyojuro continues his attack on Akaza despite his grievous injuries

Back in the present, the Flame Hashira swings his sword at Akaza's neck, much to the latter's astonishment. Kyojuro thanks his mother for giving birth to him, calling it an honor, and presses the attack deeper into the Demon's neck. Akaza attempts to punch the Hashira with his free arm, but Kyojuro stops it with his own, to the Upper Rank's continued shock. He then notices that the sun has begun to rise and attempts to finish Kyojuro off, but realizes that his arm is stuck in the Hashira's abdomen. Kyojuro determinedly vows to not let Akaza escape.

As the sun begins to rise, Tanjiro sees an opportunity to defeat Akaza and rushes towards the Demon. Desperate to escape the sunlight, Akaza struggles to free himself from Kyojuro's grip, but the Hashira's burning determination keeps Akaza trapped in place as his blade cuts his neck. Tanjiro yells at Inosuke to move for Kyojuro's sake, and the masked youth complies, rushing forward to attack Akaza.

As Inosuke prepares to utilize his Beast Breathing, First Fang: Pierce, the Upper Rank manages to escape at the last moment, sacrificing both of his arms, with Kyojuro's blade still stuck in his neck. He tries to flee into the nearby forest to escape the coming sunlight, but Tanjiro hurls his sword at the Demon, impaling him through the chest.

The young Demon Slayer angrily chastises Akaza for running away like a coward, angering the Upper Rank. Akaza looks back at Tanjiro, disgusted by his stupidity for thinking that he would be running away from them, instead of trying to evade the sunlight. Tanjiro continues his rant, stating that the Demon Slayers would always risk their lives to hunt Demons, even at night when they were at a disadvantage and unable to regrow or repair their bodies.

Inosuke trembling after Kyojuro's fight
Inosuke and Tanjiro tremble after Kyojuro's fight.

Tanjiro calls Akaza a coward as he escapes into the forest, then proceeds to proclaim Kyojuro to be stronger and the true victor of their battle. Inosuke begins to tremble as he watches Tanjiro begin to wail, with tears streaming down his face. An appreciative Kyojuro gently tells him to stop crying, expressing his concern that Tanjiro's wounds would open up again. Kyojuro tells him that if he reopens his wounds and dies from his injuries, then Kyojuro would've lost the battle from failing to protect his comrades. He proceeds to instruct Tanjiro to come and have a final chat with him and the tearful youth complies. Tanjiro sits before Kyojuro with tears streaming down his face, as the Hashira begins to relay what he had remembered from his flashbacks.
Four months after the passing of Kyojuro Rengoku, the three boys have been training relentlessly at the Butterfly Mansion while occasionally leaving on individual missions. As Zenitsu goes on solo missions, he becomes less of a whiner whereas Inosuke becomes more reckless. Despite the unforgiving training sessions, Tanjiro remarks that they're tolerable since the three boys can endure it together.

Tengen kidnapping Aoi and Naho CH70
Tengen kidnapping Aoi and Naho.

Following the completion of one of his solo missions, Tanjiro approaches the Butterfly Mansion to hear the screams of the young girls. Inside the property, Aoi and Naho scream to be let go after the Sound Hashira, Tengen Uzui begins to take them away while the other girls plea for their freedom. Aoi calls out for Kanao's help to save them, although she initially hesitates on what to do, Kanao chases after Tengen and grabs hold of Aoi and Naho.

Tengen looks at Kanao and tells her to obey her orders, but when she doesn't respond to him, he gets agitated and tells her to say something while calling her a "stuck-up pig." The other girls get scared by his sudden yelling but they manage to muster up their courage to swarm, and stop him from kidnapping Aoi and Naho. Easily.


Kanao trying to rescue Aoi and Naho.

By this point, Tanjiro arrives inside the property and although he initially gets confused as to whether the girls are crowding him or attacking him, he decides to headbutt Tengen in order to free the girls. However, Tengen stealthily escapes the headbutt, revealing that he previously used to be ninja and would not let anyone land an attack that.

Tanjiro angrily demands that Tengen returns the girls while Kiyo and Sumi insult him with names, causing Tengen to get riled up at their disrespect and demand that they obey him as their "superior officer." However, Tanjiro stubbornly refuses to acknowledge Tengen as his superior causing him to explode with anger. During his fit of rage, Tengen explains that he needs female corps members in order to carry out his mission, yelling that since they aren't Tsuguko, he doesn't need to ask Shinobu for permission.

"It's an entertainment district where Demons dwell"
Tengen announces their journey to the Entertainment District.

Kiyo cries out that Naho isn't a corps member, so Tengen nonchalantly throws her off the roof and decides to only take Aoi. Unwilling to give her up, Tanjiro demands that he gives her up and offers to go in her place. At that moment, Zenitsu and Inosuke arrive to help protect the girls, and they also offer to go on the mission as well.

Tengen ultimately gives in and smacks Aoi on the behind before returning her to the girls. As the group of boys sets off on the mission, the ask Tengen where they're going exactly to which he responds, "the flashiest place in Japan, steeped lust and avarice." ultimately revealing that they are heading towards the Entertainment District.

The chapter begins with Tengen instructing and establishing his status as a superior to the trio of Demon Slayers. He specifically details his status as a 'god' and demands that they "bow and scrape and avert [their] eyes."

Tengen establishes his rules


Being genuinely intrigued, Tanjiro cheekily falls for his flamboyance and asks what it is that Tengen rules over as a god. Sensing the absurdity of the scenario, Zenitsu concludes that Uzui is a sign of bad news and is also astonished by Tanjiro's naivety.

Tengen explains that he is the 'god of festivals' and upon hearing this, Inosuke brazenly introduces himself as the 'god of the mountain' and introduces himself as a fellow, leaving Tengen disgusted.

Tengen instructs the group to follow him to a wisteria-crested House where they will discuss their plans and within an instant, he sprints a large distance till he can barely be seen, leaving the group to chase after him in a panic. Once they arrive at the home, Tengen informs the group to be on the lookout for someone he can marry, which infuriates Zenitsu. He angrily tells Tengen to stop screwing around and to stop using members of the corps to be his matchmaker. Tengen blows up and yells that he doesn't need a matchmaker since he's already married, and that they're searching for his wife who failed to respond to his letters. Zenitsu doesn't believe him and tells Tengen to stop telling his "fantasies" causing Tengen to angrily wack him in the face with the piles of letters.

Tanjiro begins to sift through the letters, noticing the large quantity and comments that she must be a fast writer, to which Tengen clarifies that the large quantity is due to the fact that he has three wives. After hearing this, Zenitsu's head explodes with rage thinking that Tengen is lying, and he demands to know how he could have three wives. Tengen gets angry at his remarks and punches Zenitsu in the stomach with such force, knocking him unconscious.

Inosuke getting punched by Tengen.

Tanjiro begins to ask how they plan on sneaking into the district, leaving Tengen to explain that they will be disguised. His wives, which are kunoichi, were originally stationed there after he failed to find any leads as a customer, but after they narrowed down the possible locations of where the Demon might be, they lost communication. Overhearing the situation, Inosuke bluntly asks what if the wives are already dead, to which Tengen promptly punches him in the stomach, knocking him unconscious.

Within the Entertainment District, a majority of the workers are individuals who were sold into the business due to poverty and debt. As a courtesan, their job is to appeal and entertain customers so they can eventually find a wealthy man that's willing to buy their freedom. The highest classification of a courtesan is an oiran, who is considered to be the most artistic, beautiful, and educated and is thus only reserved for the wealthiest of customers.

Inosuke, Tanjiro, and Zenitsu disguised as girls CH71
The boys disguised as girls.

As the group finally arrives, Tengen uses his charming looks to try to give away the boys who are disguised as girls, and is successfully able to give Tanjiro away to the Tokito House. Tengen proceeds down the street with the other two boys in tow, with Zenitsu seething with anger at the fact that Tengen is proudly flaunting his visuals. Inosuke and Tengen notice a courtesan precession coming towards them on the street, and learn that the orian named Koinatsu is on her way to greet a suitor. Zenitsu notices the orian and angrily yells at Tengen demanding to know if that's his wife as well, earning him a punch in the face.

A woman approaches Tengen and asks him if he is looking for a house and offers to take Inosuke into the Ogimoto House, to which Tengen accepts. The chapter concludes with Zenitsu fearfully realizing that he is the only one left with Tengen.

Tanjiro is left shocked by Tengen's swift victory over Daki, but the Sound Hashira reminds him that the fight isn't over, as his sister is still out of control. Tanjiro struggles to restrain her, with Tengen suggesting he sing her a lullaby to put her to sleep. At that moment, Nezuko regains her footing and jumps out of the window, taking her brother with her as they continue to struggle. Realizing his words aren't reaching her, Tanjiro asks his mother what he should do, and then remembers Tengen's earlier advice to sing Nezuko a lullaby.

He begins to sing her a song that their mother had sung in the past, and while her actions remain unchanged at first, his lullaby soon reaches her. Nezuko remembers asking their mother about the song when she was a child, causing her to break down in tears. Nezuko comes to her senses and changes from her advanced demonized form back into her regular child-like state, promptly falling asleep. Tanjiro lets out a relieved sigh as he successfully holds Nezuko in his lap.

Daki throws a tantrum
Daki begins to throw a tantrum over Tengen denying her Upper Rank status.

Back in the house, Daki screams at Tengen for cutting her head off, and he responds by telling her to die quietly. The enraged Demon reminds him that he had denied her Upper Rank status, which he affirms, but she proceeds to insist her status, much to his annoyance.

Gyutaro confronts Tengen
Emerging from her body, Daki's brother confronts Tengen.

To the Hashira's astonishment, Daki begins to throw a tantrum and cry, and he notes that she has been talking for far too long when she should have showed signs of dying. Still throwing her tantrum, Daki calls out to "Gyutaro" to save her and a male Demon begins to emerge from her body. Tengen senses the danger and attempts to immediately attack the two, but his blades hit nothing but air as the Demons disappear from his sight. On the other side of the room behind Tengen, Gyutaro comforts Daki, asking that she at least try to reattach her own head. Tengen wonders why Daki is still alive after being beheaded, as well as the presence of the new Demon, who he comments as having great reaction speed. Gyutaro tells Daki to heal her burn, complimenting her good looks, and wounds Tengen when he attempts to attack them again.

Gyutaro compliments Tengen's attempt to attack him as well as his success at blocking his attack. He reveals that he was intending to kill Tengen with that attack and eerily prepares to him on in a battle.

Within the Entertainment District there are men known as "gyu's" or barkers, who work to attract customers to enter the brothels. Gyutaro worked as one of these men, and eventually named himself using the word "gyu." Inside one of the brothels, Gyutaro and Tengen are about to engage in combat but before they do so, Gyutaro begins to analyze Tengen's appearance. He comments about his nice face, good skin, and height mentioning that he must attract a lot of attention from women. Gyutaro begins to eerily scratch at his face until he begins to bleed, and voices his jealousy over Tengen's looks.

In the corner of the room, Daki can be seen crying as she whines at Gyutaro to kill the other Demon Slayers who burned her as well. She proceeds to tell him that they "ganged" up on her and she tried her hardest to kill her, causing Gyutaro to seethe with anger. Using two large sickles, he creates a flurry of large arc-like slashes aiming them towards Tengen.

Elsewhere in the district, Tanjiro can be seen carrying Nezuko as he rushes to put her away to safety. He looks up into the sky and sees the sickles return back in the direction that they came like a boomerang, he becomes concerned when he smells Tengen's blood and rushes to return to help. At that moment, Inosuke and Zenitsu can be seen prancing towards him as they comically announce their arrival. Tanjiro quickly informs them to help Tengen and Inosuke reassures him that he's going to be "reeeeal" flashy, before pardoning Tanjiro to put Nezuko in her box.

Flying Blood Sickles
Gyutaro using his Blood Demon Art.

Back at the brothel, Gyutaro seethes with jealousy after witnessing how "cool" Tengen looks by protecting the bystanders within the home, causing him to brag about his appearance and marriage to three women. Gyutaro pauses in astonishment before furiously scratching his face after hearing of Tengen's polygamy, he proceeds to use his Blood Demon Art: Flying Blood Sickles to try to kill the Hashira, but Tengen manages to block it. A large explosion causes the floor beneath Tengen to give in and he manages to escape by dropping down one floor, however Gyutaro commands his sickles to turn and they come straight for Tengen, yet again.

Daki and Gyutaro fighting together
Daki fights alongside Gyutaro.

By this point, Tengen has realized Gyutaro's ability to change the sickles direction and tries to formulate a plan on how to defeat the siblings. He therorizes that in order to kill the Demons, he would need to cut off Gyutaro's head instead of Daki's and he tries to test it out. Tengen grabs 3 small balls and throws them into the air, he proceeds to aim for them and precisely hits them to cause an explosion within the brothel.

As the brothel begins to crumble, Tengen is seen standing on the rubble as he admits it won't be easy to defeat the Demons. He looks at the large obi ball before him, and the siblings emerge unscathed as they confidently proclaim that they fight as one.

After successfully finding the box and returning Nezuko inside, Tanjiro quickly tries to return to the battlefield in order to assist Tengen Uzui.

Tengen grows angry with the Demons
Tengen becomes fed up with Gyutaro's comments.

Back at the battlefield, Gyutaro scowls as he mentions Tengen's supreme abilities, calling him different and talented compared to the other Hashira he's killed. His comments somewhat irritate Tengen and he berates him for thinking that he's talented compared to other people on the planet, calling him ignorant. He grows more and more angry as he recalls the people he's lost over the years despite being called the supposed "chosen" individual by Gyutaro. After listening to him speak, Gyutaro grows irritated at the fact that he has not died yet, revealing that his poison drenched sickles should have killed him.

Tengen explains that he has built a resistance to poison as he was raised in a shinobi household with nine siblings, but by the age of fifteen, seven of them had already died. His father was a cold and heartless individual who would regularly forced them to undergo intense training and as a result, his brother adopted the same ruthless and cold hearted personality. Unable to understand that type of mindset, Tengen left his clan alongside his wives, and approached Kagaya Ubuyashiki to become members of the Corps. Kagaya had warned them it would be hard to reject the values they were raised in, but openly welcomed and thanked Tengen's family for deciding to put their lives at risk to protect others.

Tengen attacks Daki and Gyutaro
Tengen attacks the siblings.

In the present, Gyutaro notices the deterioration in Tengen's physical state and becomes gleeful when he realizes that his poison is slowly taking effect. Tengen proceeds to refute his claim saying that he is still in pristine condition and charges forward to attack the siblings. As they engage in a battle, Tengen manages to kick Daki away from Gyutaro and releases numerous dark beads which cause a cluster of explosions. By setting a distraction, Tengen attempts to decapitate Gyutaro while only hold the tip of one end of his blades but it is promptly blocked by the Demon.

As both sides reassess the situation, Daki is left whining as she pathetically reattaches her head to her body once again. Gyutaro confronts Tengen about discovering the method on how to defeat them but he feigns his innocence pretending not to notice.

Inosuke and Zenitsu arrive to help Tengen
Zenitsu and Inosuke arrive to assist in the battle.

Despite Tengen's discovery, Gyutaro cockingly says that despite knowing their weakness, Tengen will still die from the poisoning since the Demons have the advantage in the battle. At that moment, Zenitsu and Inosuke arrive to question the validity of Gyutaro's claim that they're going to win. The two boys flamboyantly announce their arrival to the fight which confuses everyone at the moment, but then Tanjiro drops down from the ceiling above them and stands between the injured Tengen and the Demons, preparing to fight.
Makio and Suma can be seen frantically trying trying to evacuate the citizens of the district as the battle resumes against the Demons. Gyutaro tries to discourage and the three new arrivals and manages to intimidate Tanjiro, however Tengen Uzui comes up behind them and proudly announces that they're going to win. As Daki finishes reattaching her head, she loudly doubts his words by saying that they can't win since the Hashira has been poisoned.

Tanjiro envisions Kyojuro
Tanjiro envisions Kyojuro when Tengen speaks.

Unfazed, Tengen once again proudly announces their intent to win and speaks highly of the three boys. Looking back at him, Tanjiro sees the persona of Kyojuro Rengoku emitting from Tengen as he speaks which excites Inosuke.

Gyutaro nearly striking Tanjiro
Gyutaro attacks Tanjiro.

Gyutaro and Daki get riled up and reveal that they've eaten 15 and 7 Hashira respectively, and begin to attack the group. As Daki attempts to attack Tengen and Tanjiro from behind, Zenitsu bursts through the home within seconds to block the attack as Inosuke follows him. Now on the rooftop, Daki finally recognizes Zenitsu from the Kyogoku House and he demandingly commands her to apologize to the girl whom he had found crying earlier. She mocks his speech by revealing that women are treated like merchandise within the district and as the orian, she was allowed to do as she pleased with other people since she was the main breadwinner of the house. When she looks up at Zenitsu, a third eye appears on Daki's forehead revealing that Gyutaro can see them via her new eye.

Inosuke and Zenitsu face Daki
Zenitsu and Inosuke face Daki.

Back in the brothel, Tanjiro becomes intimidated by Gyutaro's evil aura but formulates a plan to counter his attacks and protect Tengen. However, the Demon manages to rush towards Tanjiro within an instant and catch him off guard, narrowly piercing him through his jaw. Before he can do so, Tengen grabs Tanjiro by the nape of his clothes and throws him to safety before engaging in battle with Gyutaro.

As he crash lands and looks back to see the two fighting, Tanjiro senses an ominous object approaching them from above, and Daki's obi can be seen crashing down all around them. On the rooftop, Daki can be heard cackling as she admits she is now displaying her full strength since Gyutaro is awake and allowing her to used his enhanced senses. Zenitsu and Inosuke can be seen covered in cuts and wounds as they prepare to engage with Daki in battle. The chapter concludes with Gyutaro disregarding Tengen's claims of the boys being Tsuguko, undermining their capabilities as swordsmen.

The Demon Slayers can be seen engaging in battle with the two Demons of the Entertainment District, fighting ferociously on the rooftop and inside one of the brothels. As the building begins to collapse, Tengen Uzui finds himself getting cornered between two of Gyutaro's attacks however Tanjiro jumps in and manages to protect him from the slashes. Tengen proceeds to use Sound Breathing, Fifth Form: String Performance to try to corner Gyutaro, but Daki's obi interferes and protects her brother from the attacks.

Hinatsuru body image
Hinatsuru using her Kunai box

Tengen begins to be pushed back by the obi, however Tanjiro moves in to cut the obi and tries to distract Gyutaro. The Hashira is left amazed at Tanjiro's endurance despite suffering a serious shoulder wound and realizes that Tanjiro had tied his sword to his hand to prevent him from dropping it due to exhaustion. Meanwhile on the rooftop, Inosuke and Zenitsu can be seen struggling as they try to evade the attacks from Daki's obi. The boys realize that Daki is know attacking them with the blood blades used by Gyutaro, making it impossible for them to approach her.

Now that the brothel has been destroyed, Tengen and Tanjiro are left to fight Gyutaro and the obi beneath the night sky. On a nearby rooftop, Hinatsuru appears carrying a large box filled with kunai darts and proceeds to launch dozens of them down below onto Gyutaro. At first he is left confused behind the random attack, but then Gyutaro utilizes his Blood Demon Art: Rampant Arc Rampage to deflect them away from him.

Rampant Arc Rampage
Gyutaro using his Blood Demon Art.

Gyutaro is left shocked when Tengen proceeds to attack him despite getting pierced with the darts. He attempts to decapitate him with his sickle, however Tengen manages to evade his attack and successfully cut off his legs. At that moment, Gyutaro is struck on the neck by one of the kunai darts and fails to regenerate his feet, realizing that the darts were coated with wisteria extract.

As his body begins to go numb, Tanjiro closes in on him to try to decapitate Gyutaro, leaving him seething with curiosity as the Demon Slayers quickly gain the upper hand.

The kunai darts which were utilized by Hinatsuru were revealed to be coated in a poison which would generally paralyze a Demon for half a day, or possibly immobilize a Lower Rank. She can be seen on a nearby rooftop pleading for the poison to work for even just a moment, as the Demon Slayers attempt to decapitate Gyutaro. However at that moment, Gyutaro manages to regenerate his legs and proceeds to attack them at a close vicinity.

Rotating Circular Slashes - Flying Blood Scythes
Gyutaro uses his Blood Demon Art.

He uses his Blood Demon Art, Rotating Circular Slashes: Flying Blood Scythes to emit numerous blood slashes to attack them. Before they can reach him, Tengen Uzui grabs hold of Tanjiro and throws him back to protect him from the attack. Within seconds, Tengen uses Sound Breathing, Fourth Form: Constant Resounding Slashes to deflect Gyutaro's attack but finds that he has disappeared from sight. To his horror, he looks up to the roof, only to see that Gyutaro has managed to capture Hinatsuru and is about to kill her.

Tanjiro saves Hinatsuru
Tanjiro saves Hinatsuru from Gyutaro.

Tengen tries to save her however Daki's obi blocks him from reaching her. He thinks back to a moment in the past when Hinatsuru had asked to retire from the Corps following their mission, specifically remembering her asking to not harbor any regrets if any of them were to die. Back in the present, Tengen yells at Gyutaro to stop as he tries to push through. Tanjiro comes close to the building and tries to use the Hinokami Kagura to reach her however his body refuses to listen to him. Tanjiro quickly changes tactics and uses a form of the Water Breathing to quickly save Hinatsuru from Gyutaro.

Realizing that he managed to save Hinatsuru, Tanjiro decides to utilize both the Water Breathing as well as the Hinokami Kagura in order to increase his attacking power. Gyutaro is left surprised by Tanjiro's unexpected maneuver and charges at him. However at that moment, Tengen comes behind Gyutaro and swings his blade at Gyutaro's neck while openly yelling that he owes Tanjiro.

On a nearby rooftop, Inosuke can see Tengen move in as he attempts to cut off Gyutaro's head. His frustration grows as they continue to evade Daki's attacks instead of move in to try to decapitate her. Zenitsu calls out to Inosuke and explains that in order to defeat them, they just need to make sure their heads aren't connected instead of trying to decapitate the two simultaneously. Inosuke comically looks at Zenitsu amazed and calls him awesome after seeing the difference in his personality compared to his usual demeanor.

Gyutaro catches Tengen's blade
Gyutaro catches Tengen's blade in his mouth.

Meanwhile, Tanjiro assists Tengen by also trying to swing his blade down onto Gyutaro's neck, however the Demon manages to use his sickles to halt both of their attacks and attempts to absorb their blades. Tengen uses his free arm to use his second blade to pierce the Gyutaro, but his quick reflexes allow him to catch the tip of the blade in his mouth. Sensing that Gyutaro is about to unleash more blood blades, Tengen tells Tanjiro to hang in there as Hinatsuru yanks Tanjiro away from them, allowing Tengen to leap off of the roof while pulling the Demon with him.

Before he can leap down to help them, a voice can be heard telling them to watch out as Inosuke and Zenitsu crash onto the roof while fighting the obi. Inosuke and Zenitsu ask Tanjiro for help in order to defeat Daki, and agrees asking that they finish quickly in order to help Tengen. Hinatsuru tells the boys that she will hide quickly in order to allow them to focus on the battle, and disappears as they face Daki.

Thunderclap and Flash - Eightfold
Inosuke, Tanjiro and Zenitsu attacking Daki.

She gets excited when Tanjiro joins their fight and informs his comrades that they need a fast attack in order to cut her neck. Inosuke realizes that she has slowed down and decides to go first to attack as Zenitsu agrees with Tanjiro to protect him from behind. Inosuke proceeds to dash forward using Beast Breathing, Eighth Fang: Explosive Rush while Zenitsu and Tanjiro use Thunder Breathing, First Form: Thunderclap and Flash, Eightfold and Water Breathing, Third Form: Flowing Dance respectively, to protect Inosuke from the obi.

Daki begins to crack under the pressure as Inosuke close in on her, and manages to draw both of his blades on either side of her neck. Inosuke buries his heels into the ground as he uses Beast Breathing, Sixth Fang: Palisade Bite to effectively decapitate Daki. Tanjiro smiles with joy as he witnesses Inosuke leap and catch Daki's head in the air, rejoicing at successfully cutting off her head. Inosuke claims they have to act fast and keep her head separated from her body.

Having successfully decapitated Daki, Inosuke can be seen escaping with her head in order to prevent her from reattaching it to her body. He tells the other boys not to worry about him and to instead help Tengen, but before he can get to safety, Daki uses her hair to put up a resistance.

Gyutaro stabs Inosuke
Gyutaro stabs Inosuke to rescue his sister.

He manages to put a stop to her resistance but before he can get away, Gyutaro appears behind him and impales him through the chest. Tanjiro looks on in horror as Gyutaro grabs Daki's head while Inosuke collapses on the roof, he then looks down on the ground and is once again horrified to see Tengen laying bleeding and unresponsive on the ground. Zenitsu tries to warn Tanjiro of the oncoming obi attack, but before he can escape, the roof collapses from beneath him and Tanjiro falls to the ground seemingly buried beneath the rubble. As he falls unconscious, he apologizes to everyone and specifically to Nezuko for losing the battle.

Nezuko appears in Tanjiro's dream
Nezuko appears while Tanjiro is unconscious.

In his dream, Nezuko can be seen telling him to stop apologizing for any faults in their lives or for feeling unworthy. She reassures him that it isn't his fault that their lives were ruined and tells him they'll work together to make a better future for themselves. Nezuko begins to cry as her body morphs from her human form to her Demon form and she pleads for him to never apologize for any regrets and tells him she understands how he feels.

Tanjiro awakens from his dream and tries to recollect his thoughts but before he gets up, Gyutaro can be seen standing over him, questioning if he's still alive. Gyutaro takes it upon himself to tell Tanjiro that Inosuke was pierced through the heart, Zenitsu was suffering and trapped beneath the rubble, and Tengen's heart had stopped due to the poison. He proceeds to refer to all of them as pathetic and asks Tanjiro how the Demon in the box is related to him, and he responds by saying she's his younger sister. Gyutaro begins to laugh at Tanjiro's pathetic attempt to protect his sister and tells him he should be using his hands, before proceeding to break his fingers.

Tanjiro headbutts Gyutaro
Tanjiro makes a final effort to escape.

As Tanjiro withers on the ground in pain, Gyutaro proceeds to berate him for his weakness and pulls him by the hair. He teases Tanjiro and tells him to try to decapitate him, but instead of attacking him, he slaps his hand on a small bag and hangs his head down in defeat. Believing that he broke Tanjiro's fighting spirit, he reveals his grand idea of offering Tanjiro the opportunity to become a Demon for the sake of his sister. Tanjiro suddenly looks up into the sky and Gyutaro asks him if he's trying to hold back his tears but to his surprise, Tanjiro responds that he had been preparing for the moment.

With his face gets close to Gyutaro's, Tanjiro brings his head down and headbutts him with a great force momentarily stunning him. Daki screams at him to get up but as his legs falter, and looks down to discover that a kunai dart has been lodged into his leg. He realizes that when Tanjiro had looked down, he opened a bag given to him by Hinatsuru which contained wisteria poison. Tanjiro manages to stand up while Gyutaro remains paralyzed and crouched before him, and uses his remaining strength to swing the blade down onto his neck.
Having regained his footing and subdued Gyutaro, Tanjiro manages to draw his blade onto Gyutaro's neck and press down to try to decapitate him. As he try to forces the blade down, Tanjiro envisions himself in Gyutaro's place and thinks that if he were in his situation, he would want his comrades to kill him before he could live as a Demon.

Zenitsu gets out of the wreckage CH93
Zenitsu escapes from the wreckage.

On a nearby rooftop, Daki can be seen rushing to her feet at the sudden change of events to try to help her brother, but before she can get close to them, Zenitsu manages to free himself from the rubble. He attacks her by using Thunder Breathing, First Form: Thunderclap and Flash to bring her attention to him and then uses Godspeed to quickly attack her neck. Zenitsu pleads with his blade to cut through her neck, since he was given the chance to escape the rubble and attack her while Gyutaro was subdued.

Tengen protects Tanjiro from the sickle
Tengen protects Tanjiro from the sickle.

Tanjiro continues to struggle to try to cut through Gyutaro's neck but before he can do so, Gyutaro manages to emit his blood blades to repel his sword. Tanjiro is knocked off balance as Gyutaro regains his footing, causing them to reengage in battle. Gyutaro gains the upper hand and brings his sickle down onto Tanjiro's neck, however at that moment Tengen, regains his consciousness and protects him from the sickle.

Despite being severely poisoned and missing his left hand, Tengen engages in head to head combat with Gyutaro while remarking that he's perfected the Musical Score Technique. It is revealed that his technique allows him to analyze maneuvers of his opponents and read them like notes on a piece of sheet music. However the poison has hindered his attacking ability meaning that he can only defend Gyutaro's attacks.

Tanjiro gets stabbed through the jaw
Tanjiro gets stabbed through the jaw.

Gyutaro manages to land a powerful attack to the left side of Tengen's face resulting in the loss of his left eye, and proceeds to stab Tengen. Tanjiro yells out to Tengen after witnessing him get stabbed, but Tengen orders him to ignore him and jump. Tanjiro leaps into the air towards Gyutaro and attempts to decapitate him, but is seemingly stabbed through the jaw by Gyutaro's sickle. The Demon begins to panic as they gain the upper hand and pulsate his poison to try to kill Tanjiro, however he proceeds to endure the pain, and swings his blade towards Gyutaro.

At the beginning of the chapter, it is revealed that the Demon siblings were able to keep the Demon Slayers at bay through a hidden ability. During the battle, Gyutaro was controlling his sister and was able to see through her point of view, giving them the advantage. His poison also affected the Demon Slayers greatly, but there was always a member of the team that would slip through, allowing them to continue the fight.

Tanjiro's Demon Slayer Mark emerges
Tanjiro's Demon Slayer Mark emerges as he attacks Gyutaro.

Tanjiro can be seen swinging his blade down onto Gyutaro's neck, despite the Demon's sickle piercing through his jaw. His arm strength isn't enough to slice through his neck so he resorts to forcing his entire body to push through, ignoring the pain. Gyutaro notices the change in Tanjiro's scar as he develops a Demon Slayer Mark and his eyes roll back in his head. The change in his demeanor proves to be too great as Tanjiro's blade cuts through Gyutaro's neck, causing him to panic.

Inosuke assists to decapitate Daki

Meanwhile, Daki can be seen resisting Zenitsu's attempt to decapitate her. She attempts to use her obi to kill Zenitsu at close range, but Inosuke unexpectedly rushes up revealing that he protected his heart from being stabbed by rearranging his organs. He also reveals that poison has no effect on him since he was raised on the mountains, before proceeding to assist Zenitsu in decapitating Daki.

The three boys let out a roar as they muster out the strength to slice through the Demons necks. After the long battle, Zenitsu and Inosuke manage to decapitate Daki up on the rooftop while Tanjiro can be seen decapitating Gyutaro simultaneously on the ground. Their heads fall onto the ground and roll around until they end up face to face.

Tanjiro beheading Gyutaro CH94
The Demon heads are decapitated.

As Gyutaro's body falls onto the ground, Tengen notices something being emitted from it and becomes alarmed. Meanwhile up on a nearby rooftop, Suma, Hinatsuru, and Makio have arrived to witness the end of the battle. As Makio begins to bicker with Suma over her behavior, Hinatsuru notices something is amiss down on the battlefield.

She looks down to see Tanjiro struggling to breathe as he bleeds out from his jaw, while trying to slow down the poison. Tanjiro looks over at Tengen who's sitting down in front of him and yelling at him with a panicked expression. However, Tanjiro fails to comprehend his sudden alarm as Tengen looks at him with horror.

Underneath the night sky, Nezuko can be seen looking down at her brother with a concerned expression. As Tanjiro begins to regain consciousness, he looks around to see the destroyed buildings around him. Nezuko nudges her brother as a way of letting him know that she was the one who saved him from the destruction.

Tanjiro attempts to get up to search for the others, but his legs give out from beneath him and he collapses onto the ground. He hears someone calling out to him in the distance and recognizes the voice as belonging to Zenitsu, and is unexpectedly picked up and carried by Nezuko. The pair move towards the source of the commotion and discover Zenitsu has awakened from his slumber, not remembering any of the events that had transpired. He tells Tanjiro that he can hear Inosuke's heartbeat get weaker and weaker and points to him laying unconscious nearby.

Nezuko healing Inosuke
Nezuko heals Inosuke by setting him on fire.

The siblings rush over to him and Tanjiro attempts to wake Inosuke up, but to his dismay he feels his heart get weaker. Tanjiro begins to panic and thinks of exposing him to sunlight, or sending a crow to Shinobu for help but realizes he doesn't have time for either of the options. His tears begin to well up as Inosuke lays dying before him, but Nezuko comes forward and unexpectedly sets Inosuke on fire. Tanjiro looks on amazed as he witnesses Inosuke's poisoned skin heal right before his eyes, and his comrade suddenly awakens to announce he's hungry. The three rejoice at the fact that he's okay and embrace as Tanjiro begins to sob.

Elsewhere on the battlefield, Suma begins to wail loudly while pleading for Tengen to live after winning the battle. Her co-wife, Makio, begins to panic as she realizes the antidote they administered is not working to remove the poison from his body, and Hinatsuru begins to weep. Realizing that he doesn't have much time left to live, Tengen begins to relay his final words to his wives, but is interrupted by Suma's loud wails. Makio becomes enraged at Suma's overreactive cries and begins to pull her by the hair and shove rocks into her mouth to make her be quiet, while Hinatsuru tries to prevent them from bickering. In a comical fashion, Tengen sits spectating as his wives continue to bicker while his final moments slip away, he then realizes that he can no longer move his speak due to the poison.

Nezuko setting Tengen on fire
Nezuko sets Tengen on fire.

Everyone momentarily pauses when Nezuko suddenly appears next to Tengen, they proceed to stare at her as she raises her hand and grabs his arm, before setting him on fire. His wives look on in horror until Suma comically pulls Nezuko away, saying that its too soon to cremate him. To their surprise, Tengen begins to speak again and asks how its possible that the poison has been removed from his body, bringing relief to his wives. Tanjiro subtly explains that Nezuko's Blood Demon Art has somehow managed to remove the poison from their bodies and expresses his relief to know that Tengen is safe. Tengen tries to tell Tanjiro to rest if not he will die from his injuries, but he informs Tengen that he needs to confirm that the Demons have been defeated before he can rest.

Gyutaro arguing with Daki
The Demon siblings begin to argue as they disintegrate.

The siblings proceed throughout the rubble in search of the Demon's heads, and come across a pool of Demon blood. Tanjiro pulls out an apparatus and decides to collect the blood in order to be studied. Once the blood has been collected, Tamayo's cat familiar, Chachamaru, appears before Tanjiro and he puts it in the box to be delivered to Tamayo.

As the siblings continue their search, Tanjiro smells the scent of the Demon's and guides Nezuko to head towards them. When they arrive, Gyutaro and Daki can be seen viciously arguing over their defeat. Their heads begin to disintegrate as they blame each other for losing the battle, with Gyutaro degrading Daki for being useless. Daki retaliates by saying that someone as ugly as Gyutaro cannot be considered her relative, which leaves Tanjiro looking at them concerned about the hurtful words they are spewing at each other.
Daki and Gyutaro continue arguing as their heads begin to disintegrate, she starts chastising her brother for being useless and questions if they're even related. Gyutaro grows angry at her comments and calls her a weakling, even regretting protecting her in the first place. He loses his temper and goes on to spew hateful remarks such as mentioning that his life would've been better without her and wishing that she had never been born, causing Daki's eyes to well up with tears. Tanjiro intervenes and covers Gyutaro's mouth, stating that he doesn't mean what he's saying and that they shouldn't spend their final moments fighting with each other.

Daki begins to wail at Tanjiro out of frustration, yelling at him to leave them alone and stop lecturing them. Daki's head reaches its last phases of disintegration and she cries out for her brother to save her, saying that she doesn't want to die. Gyutaro hopelessly watches as her head dissolves away while still calling out him, before he impulsively calls out to her by her birth name, Ume.

As he reaches his final moments, Gyutaro recalls his past as a human born in the Kirimise to a prostitute mother. Before she died from syphilis, his mother tried to kill him many times, even after his younger sister was born. Due to his appearance, his voice and lack of hygiene, the young Gyutaro was bullied and detested by everyone he met. Things began to change after his sister was born, as her beauty dismissed his inferiority complex, and he used his ugliness, plus his newfound fighting skills, to become an efficient debt collector.

Gyutaro's rage
Gyutaro returns from a job, only to find his sister horribly burned due to the actions of a vengeful samurai.

However, the good fortune would not last for the siblings. When Ume turned 13, she blinded a samurai with a comb, and was subsequently burned alive for her crime. Having been away on his job at the time, Gyutaro returned to find her barely alive, and hugged her as she clinged to life. He cursed the gods to return his sister and for treating them cruelly, before he is attacked by the same samurai. The samurai slashes Gyutaro from behind, allowing him to bleed out at he chats with one of the brothel managers.

The manager brazingly calls Gyutaro a nuisance and a brute for harassing the locals of the district, before expressing her pity at having lost Ume as a courtesan. Before the samurai could finish him off, Gyutaro viciously kills the manager, and berates the samurai for having a lavish lifestyle before gruesomely killing him as well, by snapping his katana and slicing his head in half with his sickle. As Gyutaro tried to find help for him and his sister, no one would help them due to their reputation and circumstances. He trudges on through the street until he ultimately collapses and bleeds out on the floor, as snow begins to fall. The siblings lay on the floor dying, until they are discovered by one of the Upper Ranks, who offers to turn them into Demons. Gyutaro adamantly proclaims that he would become a Demon again, no matter how many times he is reborn, wanting to always bring fear as "Gyutaro the Debt Collector".
Gyutaro muses how Daki could have been if he had raised her differently, before taking note of his surroundings. A younger looking Daki appeared behind him, disgusted with their current location and wondering where the exit was. The emaciated man ordered her not to follow him anymore, getting angry when she wouldn't comply. A tearful Daki apologized for her earlier cruel insults, stating that it was because she had not wanted to accept that it was her fault that they had lost. When Gyutaro still refused to let her come with him, Daki tackled him from behind, stubbornly refusing to ever let go, vowing to always be his little sister no matter how often they are reborn, and reminding him of the promise they had made long ago to always stay together. Finally accepting her company, Gyutaro carries his sister into the fire that awaits them.

Kagaya's determination
Hearing the news about the defeat of one of the Upper Ranks, Kagaya is determined to see Muzan defeated in his generation.

In the world of the living, Tanjiro and Nezuko watch as the last of the Demon siblings dissolves into the air. Tanjiro wonders if they made up, which Nezuko affirms. Elsewhere, Obanai Iguro attempts to praise Tengen for his defeat of Upper Rank 6, but is disappointed that he beat such a low ranking member of the Twelve Kizuki, as well as lost his left arm and eye. Tengen states his intention to retire as a Hashira, but Obanai refuses to accept this, as there is already a vacant Hashira position and the lower ranks of the Demon Slayer Corps keep on dying without improving. Tengen disagrees with this last point, stating that Tanjiro is definitely improving, while Obanai is surprised he survived the fight.

Elsewhere, Kagaya Ubuyashiki learns of the group's victory and is elated, but is stricken by complications from his illness. He states that this victory will have massive consequences, enough to ensure Muzan Kibutsuji's defeat within their generation, and then collapses into a bout of coughing. At the Infinity Castle, Akaza ponders how his summoning must mean a member of the Upper Ranks has been defeated.

Akaza looks on with displeasure as the Biwa Demon plays her instrument, and is greeted by one of his Upper Rank colleagues, Gyokko. The potted Demon asks him how he's been after ninety years, and proclaims his insincere worry over Akaza being the slain Upper Rank. Hantengu corrects his colleague, as it had actually been one hundred and thirteen years since they had last been summoned, and expresses his concern over the oddity and unluckiness of the number. Ignoring them, Akaza asks the Biwa Demon if Muzan had arrived, the answer being no, and then asks if Upper Rank 1 had arrived. Before she can answer, Doma places a hand on Akaza's shoulder, asking him to show some concern for his well-being, as he did not wish to see any of his "precious buddies" die.

Gyokko and Doma exchange small talk about the former's pot and latter's use of the pot that Gyokko had given him. Akaza demands that Doma remove his hand, viciously punching him when he doesn't immediately do so. Quickly recovering from the blow, Doma pleasantly asks if Akaza had gotten stronger since they last met, enraging the tattooed Demon. The Biwa Demon finally relates that Upper Rank 1 had been the first to arrive, surprising Akaza, who quickly spotted his silent colleague. Kokushibo noted that he was present, as was their master. As each Upper Rank reacted to the silent arrival of their leader, Muzan noted that Gyutaro was dead.

Doma apologized for Gyutaro's failure, wondering what punishment Muzan would give him, but the ancient Demon declined all of his suggestions, having already anticipated Upper Rank 6's defeat. He further commented that he didn't expect anything from them, which Doma questioned, as he did not believe he had ever failed to live up to his master's expectations. Muzan countered by stating that the Ubuyashiki family had yet to be killed and the Blue Spider Lily had yet to be found, making him question why the Upper Ranks even existed. Each of the Upper Ranks offers some excuse for this failure, save Akaza and Gyokko. The latter offers Muzan some information he claims will get him closer to achieving his goals.

Akaza destroys Doma's head
Akaza viciously destroys Doma's head.

Swiftly beheading the Upper Rank, Muzan berates Gyokko for speaking of change, as he is only looking for permanence. He adds that he is "at the height of displeasure" due to an Upper Rank being killed for the first time in over a hundred years, further berating Gyokko for attempting to give him unconfirmed information. He demands that the Upper Ranks serve him with "suicidal devotion" from that moment on, orders Gyokko to head over with Hantengu if he can confirm his information, and then leaves. Doma approached Gyokko, asking to join him on his mission, and then has the upper portion of his head destroyed by Akaza. The Upper Rank 3 ordered him to get lost, as Muzan had not given him any orders.
Tanjiro Kamado puts pressure on his blade and attempts to force it through Hantengu’s neck. The Demon continues his high-pitched screeching, but Tanjiro refuses to waver. Suddenly, a dark figure appears behind them, and Tanjiro notices that it does not smell like any of the previous emotion Demons. Opting to ignore it, he keeps trying to behead Hantengu but his sword loses its power from Nezuko Kamado. Genya Shinazugawa aims at the figure behind Tanjiro, but he is unable to shoot without possibly hitting his teammate.

Hatred Hantengu
The sixth Demon.

The mysterious Demon hits a drum and a giant, dragon-faced tree immediately sprouts. Nezuko barely manages to jump in and save her brother, losing her leg in the process. She immediately regrows it right before they land but suffers a great loss of energy. As Tanjiro makes sure she is safe, the Demon begins talking and names the negative emotions that individuals who are pure evil emit, specifically those that harm the weak. Infuriated, Tanjiro realizes that there are now six Demons but notices he can’t sense the previous four. Genya witnesses the appearance of the sixth Demon and alarmingly recounts how it used to be the anger Demon, Sekido. However, after Tanjiro struck Hantengu’s neck, Sekido had forcefully absorbed his three counterparts and transformed into the child-like Demon in front of them.

Hantengu's ability to grow stronger the worser the situation CH116
Hantengu's ability to grow stronger the worser the situation.

The Demon hits another drum and wraps Hantengu with tree trunks, shielding him. Tanjiro tries to stop him, but he and Genya are both held back at the pure strength of the sixth Demon’s aura, a result of Hantengu’s power growing as his situation worsens. The Demon labels them as ‘evil’ and when Tanjiro demands an explanation as to why, he replies that the label is reserved to those who try to hurt the weak. Furious at his words contradicting the fact that he had eaten hundreds of innocent humans, Tanjiro loudly vows to cut him down.
Still trapped in Gyokko's Water Prison Pot, Muichiro Tokito thinks to himself that he has enough air for one attack, proceeding to use Mist Breathing, First Form: Low Clouds, Distant Haze. His attempt is unsuccessful and, without any more air in his lungs, he accepts his fate, thanking Kagaya Ubuyashiki for his support and wishes him luck finding someone to replace his Hashira position. However, he is surprised by a vision of Tanjiro Kamado who tells him that nobody knows what the future will be like, a statement Tanjiro had never said to him.

Hotaru's face is revealed CH117
Hotaru's mask breaks and falls off, revealing his face.

In the nearby shed, Kozo Kanamori gets slashed by Gyokko as he desperately shields Hotaru Haganezuka from the Demon. Unaware of their presence, Hotaru fixates himself on restoring the blade given to him by Tanjiro and mutters about the incredible quality of its craftsmanship. Gyokko observes him, confirming that he is not the chief due to his age. The Demon calls out to him, but Hotaru does not respond and continues muttering about the eccentricity of the blade, a level of concentration that astonishes Gyokko. Jealous of Hotaru's fixation for his craft, Gyokko slashes him multiple times and summons another fish Demon that attacks Kozo. Hotaru continues to ignore him as his mask falls off from the attack, revealing his face, and Kozo rushes to try and snap him out of his trance. Gyokko vows to break the swordsmith's continuous persistence.

Kotetsu attempting to break the pot and save Muichiro CH117
Kotetsu attempting to break the pot and save Muichiro.

Outside, Muichiro slowly loses his ability to breathe. Tanjiro's vision keeps appearing in front of him and expresses how Muichiro himself would decide his own fate. Muichiro dismisses his word, but Tanjiro continues and informs the Mist Hashira that someone would come save him. Although he tries to disclose his distaste for relying on someone else, the vision of Tanjiro tells him that he sometimes has to rely on others as he cannot do everything on his own.

Muichiro listens to his remark and berates himself for not working hard enough to prevent mistakes from happening and, additionally, for overestimating himself. Suddenly, a knife enters the water and Kotetsu begs Muichiro to not die as he futilely struggles to pierces the prison. Muichiro tries to get him to go protect the chief rather than worry about him, but Kotetsu persistently keeps trying. One of Gyokko's minions appears behind the child and slashes at him; as he runs, the Demon uses its claw to stab Kotetsu at his solar plexus. Seeing this attack on his vital point, Muichiro deems the boy dead.

Kotetsu blows in a breath of air CH117
Kotetsu blows in a breath of air.

However, Kotetsu stays standing and returns back to the water, blowing air into it and transferring a breath from him to Muichiro. As Muichiro inhales the air, he remembers Tanjiro's words about how helping others would in turn help him and connects his words to a man, Muichiro's father. Freshly motivated, the Hashira uses Mist Breathing, Second Form: Eight-Layered Mist and successfully destroys the water prison.

As he escapes the prison, Muichiro Tokito realizes that Tanjiro Kamado's eyes are the same shade of red as his father's. Muichiro pulls out the needles numbing his face and begins regaining more of his memories, remembering that his father was a woodcutter. Kagaya Ubuyashiki's soothing words enter his mind and he sorrowfully thinks about his master's disease as he crawls to Kotetsu, cutting apart the fish Demon that had attacked him. Muichiro's memory progression continues as he recalls his mother's death from illness and his father's death from falling off a cliff. When he tries to speak with Kotetsu, Muichiro suddenly remembers about his older brother, Yuichiro Tokito, his twin and sole companion after their parents' death when they were ten.

Muichiro's past with his older brother CH118
Muichiro's past with his older twin brother, Yuichiro.

Thinking back to his past, Muichiro recalls Yuichiro's blunt personality after they were orphaned and how he ridiculed their father for trying to save their mother, a man who had died when aiming to help others. Crying, Muichiro unsuccessfully attempted to get Yuichiro to stop insulting their father and instead received insults from him regarding the first character in his name, "Mu" (無?), which could be interpreted as "nothingness." The twins continued to live together despite their strained relationship, which Muichiro had attributed to his older brother potentially despising him.

After surviving on their own for a while, the siblings were visited by Kagaya's wife, Amane Ubuyashiki, who had told them about their swordsmen heritage. Angered by her presence, Yuichiro drove her away and intensely berated Muichiro after he had expressed his interest in becoming a swordsman, straining their relationship to the point of forfeiting any communication between them.

Muichiro's Demon Slayer Mark appears CH118
Muichiro's Demon Slayer Mark appears.

One summer night, a Demon entered the twins' home, cutting off Yuichiro's left arm and insulting the siblings' lack of worth, angering Muichiro to the point of releasing explosive rage. The boy managed to pin the Demon and crush it, watching it disintegrate as the sun rose. Crawling back to Yuichiro, Muichiro witnessed his brother's final words begging the gods to spare Muichiro as he was a good person that desired to help others, unlike himself. As Muichiro held his brother's hand, he told him that the "mu" (無?) in his name was actually meant to represent the "mu" in "infinity" (無限 mugen?).

Finally recovering his memories, Muichiro awakens his true strength and gains mist-like markings over his face as he powerfully grips his blade.
Yuichiro Tokito apologizes to his brother for his inability to be nice to him and that he truly tried to protect him, clutching his hand as his memories are shifted back to reality.

Hotaru's continuous persistence CH119
Hotaru's continuous persistence.

In the shed, Gyokko is infuriated to see Hotaru Haganezuka continuing to work on the blade despite the numerous injuries he had inflicted on him, including the loss of an eye. On the side, Kozo Kanamori struggles to move and Gyokko goes to finish him off, but he is interrupted by Muichiro Tokito's attack, narrowly dodging it. Surprised at his escape from the water prison, Gyokko sees the strange markings on his face and realizes it is similar to the mark on the boy with the hanafuda earrings that Muzan Kibutsuji had told him about. The boy's composed face and attack speed despite being struck with paralyzing needles earlier bothers the Demon as Muichiro rushes in to attack again. Anticipating it, Gyokko uses his Blood Demon Art, Octopus Vase Hell. Octopus legs fill the shed and trap Muichiro as they destroy the building. At the last moment, Kozo gives Muichiro his mended Nichirin Sword.

Muichiro thanks Kozo CH119
Muichiro thanks Kozo.

Outside, Hotaru is knocked aside from the attack but pays no mind to it as he returns to sharpening the blade, his stubborn persistence puzzling the Demon. Gyokko opts to temporarily ignore the swordsmith and instead focuses on Muichiro as he wraps him and Kozo with his attack, exclaiming that he will crush them. Despite Gyokko's claim that the octopus is too powerful to be cut, Muichiro cleanly slices through it and releases him and Kozo. Brandishing his new blade, Muichiro thanks the swordsmith though Kozo denies, stating that he simply followed the instruction of his previous swordsmith.

Muichiro talking with Tetsuido CH119
Muichiro talking with Tetsuido.

Muichiro thinks back to a conversation with his aforementioned swordsmith, the late Tetsuido, when he had expressed deep concern for his client after learning of how hard he worked and how difficult it was for him to cope with his memory loss. Internally apologizing to him for causing worry, Muichiro tells Tetsuido that he is alright now and proceeds to use Mist Breathing, Fifth Form: Sea of Clouds and Haze to cut apart the rest of the octopus's tentacles.

Gyokko watches him and praises him for his speed, but retorts that the swordsman would not be able to catch up to his pace. However, Muichiro refutes his word and suggests the Demon's senses have become sluggish and a confused Gyokko witnesses his neck get cut from the Hashira's previous attack. Angered, Gyokko tells him not to underestimate his strength.
After defeating Gyokko of the Twelve Kizuki, Muichiro Tokito is approached by Kozo Kanamori who is concerned for his well being. Despite trying to reassure him that he is fine and to check on the others, Muichiro begins to foam at the mouth revealing that his blood was poisoned by Gyokko and he proceeds to fall unconscious. Kozo begins to panic and calls out to Haganezuka for help, who never comes.

Kotetsu appears from behind him in the forest and instructs Kozo to turn him on his side, scaring him in the process. Kozo is surprised to see the young boy standing before him, and asks how he's still alive despite the massive amount of blood loss. Kotetsu explains that the blood from his arm smeared onto his stomach, but he was protected from any fatal injury due to the hilt that Tanjiro had entrusted to him for his katana. Muichiro regains subtle consciousness and sees the hilt which belonged to the late Kyojuro Rengoku, causing tears to well in his eyes. Apparitions of his deceased mother, father, and brother appear all around him, congratulating him for his hard work.

Elsewhere in the forest, Tanjiro can be seen struggling to defeat Zohakuten's wooden dragon heads. He attempts to injure one of the heads using the Hinokami Kagura: Clear Blue Sky but the dragon utilizes a sound attack which causes Tanjiro to collapse and his ear drums to burst. As the dragon head launches another attack towards Tanjiro, he attempts to dodge but his foot is left injured in the process. The dragon head leaves him with no chance to escape and approaches quickly, latching onto Tanjiro's wrist before he can defend himself.

Mitsuri saving Tanjiro
Mitsuri saves Tanjiro from being crushed.

Nezuko and Genya watch helplessly unable to come to Tanjiro's aid as the dragon head begins to come down on him, crushing him in the process. However within moments, the dragon head is split in half and is subtly destroyed as a squeal of disgust can be heard in the night. Mitsuri Kanroji can be seen leaping in the air while carrying Tanjiro on her back to safety, while apologizing for her tardiness. Stunned by her appearance, Tanjiro warns her to be careful of the demon she's about to face since he is a member of the Twelve Kizuki, but she pays him no mind and proceeds to scold the demon instructing him to return Nezuko and Genya.

Unfazed by the arrival of the Hashira, Zouhakuten proceeds to insult Mitsuri by calling her a tramp, for trying to order him around. Mitsuri stares at the demon with disgust after being called a tramp and is offended by the insult. She compares him to her younger brother in a comical sense and is appalled by his behavior. Zohakuten begins to launch his attack against Mitsuri using the Crazed Cry of Thunder Death to attack her, but she is able to defend herself using Love Breathing : Third From - Catlove Shower to negate his attack. Mitsuri becomes annoyed with Zohakuten's sudden attack and leaves him surprised with her ability to stop his attack.

After Zenitsu beheads Kaigaku by performing the Thunder Breathing, Seventh Form: Honoikazuchi no Kami, both fall in the Infinity Castle to their deaths. Zenitsu plummets unconsciously as the disintegrating Kaigaku grows furious at his defeat from Zenitsu's hands. He comforts himself with the idea that Zenitsu will die with him when they hit the floor until Yushiro comes to save Zenitsu, while coldly reminding Kaigaku that without friends he will end with nothing since he gave nothing to anyone, finally commenting that "dying alone sure is pathetic". Hearing this, Kaigaku only screams in frustration as Zenitsu is saved and he meets a lonely pathetic death.

Zenitsu awakens in a land full of Red Spider Lilies and sees his master Jigoro Kuwajima across a river that separates the two. Zenitsu breaks down in front of him crying in remorse and regret for not being able to save Kaigaku and being unable to become a Hashira prior to his death. As Zenitsu struggles with being caught with the lilies, he realizes that Jigoro hasn't said anything to him. Jigoro breaks his silence by calling out Zenitsu's name and with tearful eyes he proclaims that Zenitsu is his pride and joy.

In reality, Zenitsu is being patched up by Yushiro while being guarded by Murata and another Demon Slayer. Murata realizes he remembers Zenitsu and calls out hoping for his survival, leading Yushiro to tell him to shut up. As Murata angrily comments back he cannot be treated like this as a demon slayer of rank, Yushiro responds back as a demon, he ignores them. As he patches Zenitsu's eyes, Murata shouts at the demon that the blood from Zenitsu's wounds continues to bleed. Yushiro tells Zenitsu he was lucky Kaigaku was inexperienced with his demon power; had he fought him a year later, he would have ended up dead. Murata yells not to be so negative, attracting demons to their location, to Yushiro's chagrin.

Yushiro was brought along by Tamayo to help assist the Demon Slayers, much to his frustration. Despite the fact he wore the Demon Slayer uniform to enter as no one recognized him, the other members knew something was off, the fact he was a demon created by Tamayo. Yushiro grows frustrated at Murata's inability to behead the attacking demon and places Zenitsu to safety to assist.

Meanwhile, Tanjiro and Giyu are continuing to run through the castle, Tanjiro wondering on Muzan's whereabouts and the location of everyone else. He tells Shinobu that they will win and that he is sure of that. Suddenly a powerful tremor strikes, shaking the area and worrying the two Water Breathers. As Tanjiro wonders if it is a fight, or someone's death, the tremor gets closer and stronger. Giyu tells Tanjiro to stay back as the source of the tremor punches through the ceiling, revealed to be Akaza. Akaza tells the demon slayer, "Long time no see... I'm surprised a weakling like you is still alive. Tanjiro Kamado!!", causing Tanjiro to yell his opponent's name back.

Tamayo is trapped in a flesh cocoon made by Muzan. Slowly being absorbed in, she desperately pleads for help.
While in the process of mapping out the floor plan for the Infinity Castle, Kuina begins to envision the recently deceased members of her family. Her emotions begin to overwhelm and her eyes well up with tears, but her brother Kiriya reassures her to stay strong in order to win the battle. She recomposes herself and continues map out the floor plan.

Sitting outside of the room are former Hashira, Tengen and Shinjuro standing guard. They begin conversate at how mature and wise Kiriya has become despite losing his father at such a young age. Shinjuro mentions how the youth are risking their lives and how he had decided to follow his late son, Kyojuro, and put his life on the line to protect them.

Elsewhere on the estate, Sakonji is seen caring an ill Nezuko, he reveals that he had given Nezuko a medication to revert her back to a human but questioned if it was actually taking any effect. The idea of Nezuko returning to a human would ruin Muzan's scheme of trying to conquer the sun, and she would be deemed the only demon in history to not be destroyed by sunlight. Sakonji begins to tremble at the idea of the conflict ending on that night, and being alive to witness it. He reminisces on the day when he first met Tanjiro, and how he felt that the beginning of the end had finally come to the centuries-long conflict. He quietly begins to root for Tanjiro and Nezuko, begging them not to lose.

Meanwhile within the castle, Tanjiro has begun to engage Akaza in a fight, whom lunges forward to forcefully attack first. Tanjiro is narrowly able to escape the blow by using the Hinokami Kagura: Fire Wheel to flip over Akaza. Now behind him, Tanjiro wills himself to slice Akaza's arm off and successfully manages to do so, but is swiftly attacked when Akaza manages to regenerate his arm. To his advantage, Tanjiro narrowly avoids his attack by using Hinokami Kagura: Fake Rainbow and manages to slice Akaza across the face in the process. Akaza regenerates his cut while he stares, stunned at Tanjiro's ability.

After having witnessed their small scuffle, Giyu stands amazed at Tanjiro's techniques thinking of how his ability is equal to that of a Hashira's. He recalls the snow day of when they first met, and how all he could do was beg for his sister's life, compared to how he can now fight without losing his life or dignity.

Akaza recalls the final words spoken to him by Kyojuro, "This boy isn't weak, do not insult him." and acknowledges Tanjiro's strength and informs him of his newfound respect for him. The chapter ends with Akaza initiating a Technique Development, Destructive Death: Compass Needle to fight Tanjiro in a serious manner.

Giyu uses the Water Breathing, Third Form: Flowing Dance to maneuver around Akaza, the latter recognizing him as the Water Hashira and stating it has been fifty years since he had faced a Hashira that uses the Water Breathing. Akaza responds by using his Destructive Death: Disorder, disrupting Giyu's movements and forcing him to use the Water Breathing, Eleventh Form: Dead Calm to negate the attack. The Upper Moon mentions the last Water Hashira he faced never used such a form. Tanjiro appears from behind, using the Hinokami Kagura: Raging Sun to slash at Akaza's neck, only for the blow to miss and for the demon to appear behind him instead, about to punch through his neck. Tanjiro nearly gets hit trying to use the Hinokami Kagura: Fake Rainbow to dodge, when Giyu saves him by slicing Akaza's arm off using the Water Breathing, Second Form: Water Wheel. Akaza's arm grows back nearly instantly however, and Giyu quickly attacks again, followed by Tanjiro using the Hinokami Kagura: Flame Dance. Akaza sees him trying to slice his foot and uses Leg Type: Crown Splitter, knocking the demon slayer. Tanjiro tries to parry with his blade and though he nearly comes unscathed, Akaza's leg catches Tanjiro's nose slightly, causing him to bleed heavily from the sheer force.

Tanjiro crouches down to soak up the pain, leading Giyu to face Akaza alone. Akaza compliments his opponent's sword and asks for his name, only to be denied "I don't have a name to tell to a Demon. And I hate talking, so don't bother." The demon happily responds he loves talking and will continually asking till he gives in, using Leg Type: Explosive Flurry to hit his blade handle and knocking the Hashira away through several walls. Tanjiro sees the impact and calls at to Giyu, only for Akaza to appear alongside him, excited he now knows his opponent's name. The two swing at each other, Tanjiro using the Hinokami Kagura: Burning Bones, Summer Sun and Akaza deploying his Destructive Death: Eight-Layered Demon Core in retaliation. Akaza survives the clash unscatched, while Tanjiro is forced back, slamming into a wall.

Akaza compliments his moves and for training in a short amount of time. He praises Kyojuro Rengoku for the day of their battle, as Tanjiro "was a weakling, lying down that night". Now however, he sees Tanjiro's growth in battle and is now excited to face him. Akaza voices his gratitude at Kyojuro's death, as he believes he would never had become stronger than that day, also insulting his belief to remain human. Tanjiro hears these words and, remembering Kyojuro, Shinjuro and Senjuro, becomes enraged, telling him to stop insulting the former Flame Hashira. Akaza is confused, retorting he is praising the two, while Tanjiro only tells him he is insulting Kyojuro, as well as hating anyone who faces him. The demon claims Tanjiro is misunderstanding as he only hates the weak, repulsed by them and stating the laws of nature dictate the weak become eliminated. The demon slayer responds back that the Upper Rank himself is the product of his wrong views, as he was once weak as well and had become powerful.

Tanjiro yells that "The strong protect the weak. Then the weak get stronger and help those weaker than themselves", calling it the true laws of nature. He calls Akaza's belief unforgivable and voices he will not let him do as he like any further.

Facing off against Tanjiro, Akaza cannot brush aside the unpleasant feeling he is giving him. He is unsure why he feels angry fighting him since he believes Tanjiro is no longer weak, yet cannot shake the feeling of his eyes, voice and words cutting into him. At that moment, someone grabs Akaza's shoulder and confirms Tanjiro's words; everyone starts off weak, they get help from everyone around them, but he should only compare his own progress against himself, not that of others. The man tells him the only thing important is becoming stronger than he was yesterday and soon he can be the one to help people. Angered, Akaza tries to punch behind him to hit the man, but strikes nothing. As a bewildered Tanjiro sees Akaza punch the air suddenly, Akaza angrily mutters, "Tanjiro, you really are unpleasant".

Akaza uses Destructive Death: Crushing Type, Ten-Thousand Leaves Flashing Willow and ruptures the ground around him, with Tanjiro just barely dodging the attack. As he becomes stunned at Akaza's new speed, the demon then quickly engages the Demon Slayer from below and uses his Destructive Death: Leg Type, Flying Planet Thousand Wheels, with Tanjiro taking the attack and vomiting as a result. He tries to reason as to how Akaza manages to nearly hit him with every move; all his strikes seem to aim for his vital areas and his attacks seem to be attracted to them. He thinks back to when the demon deploys his Technique Development, Destructive Death: Compass Needle, but before he can figure it out, Tanjiro dodges to the side to escape an incoming kick. Tanjiro uses the Hinokami Kagura: Solar Heat Haze but only manages to cut half way through Akaza's neck, who manages to heal the cut instantly. However, the Upper Rank is curious as to how the tip manages to appear hazy before hitting him, asking the demon slayer how he did it.

Elsewhere, in the Rengoku Estate, Senjuro prays to his late brother Kyojuro that a major battle is now active, pleading him to protect Tanjiro. Senjuro thinks to his written letter to Tanjiro where he detailed information from the Flame Hashira Chronicles about a conversation between the Sun Breathing swordsman and the Flame Hashira of that time, how the swordsman was the first Breathing user and had engage Muzan in battle. As Senjuro continues to pray to his brother that Tanjiro will survive, it is revealed the Kasugai Crow with his letter is sitting nearby, watching the battle, forcing Tanjiro to survive the battle in order to read it.

As Tanjiro attempts to use his Hinokami Kagura: Fire Wheel, Akaza catches the blade in his hands. Startled that he will attempt to break it, Tanjiro headbutts the demon but doesn't injure Akaza. He attempts to kick him but Akaza continues to grasp the sword. Suddenly, Akaza's hands are sliced off, freeing Tanjiro and his sword. Giyu returns, angered at the searing pain in his back and sarcastically thanking the Upper Moon for blasting him through several walls.
Tanjiro remembers how his father seemed like a plant; he had never shown any emotional outburst and was always gentle, maintaining his demeanour till his death. Whenever he remembers him, he immediately pictures his soft smile and calming voice. Tanjiro remembers a question he asked him about what he thinks when he performs the Hinokami Kagura. Even as a child, Tanjiro knew that the dance involved performing all twelve moves from night to dawn continuously. Worried about his frail body, Tanjiro asks if he can be the one to do it next year.

Tanjuro thanks his son for his concern but brushes aside his worry, stating that every year he performed it, he never tired. He remembers learning it from his own father, but notes that even though he was younger and healthier then, doing it exhausted him greatly. He figured out though the forms had useless moves, what mattered was using the correct breathing and movements, as well as releasing all your strength through minimal movement. Tanjuro states that by doing this, your mind becomes invisible, but to properly do so, he had to find his movement and sensations, utilise all his senses and gain complete awareness of your body. He tells his son that by doing all this, he can learn to remove unneeded parts of the Hinokami Kagura and learn just to do what is necessary and close off everything else. Tanjiro asks how can he close everything else and his father responds by saying it's like people closing their eyes to hear better. As he does this, his body will adapt and the movements will become natural. Tanjuro tells him that when your mind becomes invisible, he will see into the Transparent World but this is the end as his body would have reached its limit. As an amazed Tanjiro asks if he can do it as well, he is told he can do so by working hard and not slacking off, while being presented with new warajis.

An incident happened ten days before Tanjuro's death; a bear had come to the mountain, killing and devouring people. As the Kamado family sleeps through a blizzard, Tanjuro suddenly awakens and gets up, after which he asks his sleepy eldest son to accompany him. As Tanjuro and Tanjiro wander outside, the two encounter the very bear; two metres tall and believed to have killed six people. A frightened Tanjiro watches his father confront the bear with only an axe and his frail body.

Tanjuro apologises for its hunger but warns the creature that coming any closer will mean facing him. He tells it that if anything tries to harm his family, he will show no mercy and take its life. As the bear roars and lumbers forward to kill him, Tanjuro swings his axe and leaps up, decapitating the bear before it could move a step. As its giant head drops to the ground, Tanjiro tries to piece what had happened, In that instant, Tanjuro would have to swing twice to get completely through its neck, and with his sense of smell, he realises Tanjuro never wavered in the slightest. He had no hesitation, fear, no intent to kill, with his plant-like presence, he simply killed it.

Tanjuro looks behind and asks if his son had witnessed what happened. A shaken Tanjiro confirms he saw what took place and runs up to hug him. As he tells his son to never forget what he saw, Tanjiro looks back and realised this moment was a form of training his perception. He was supposed to learn to see into the Transparent World, like his father, grandfather and great-grandfather before him; they would have had to learn in this way. He finally understand his father's words and thinks back when he manage to suddenly dodge Akaza's strike that seemed about to connect. Though it would have surely killed him, he manage to escape it. For just a slight moment, when Akaza grabbed his blade and was poised to swing, Tanjiro had entered the Transparent World, seeing Akaza's muscles through his body, as he did to Hantengu. Managing to close off other sense to dodge something unavoidable, his body became even faster.

Apologising to Inosuke for doubting him, Tanjiro steels his resolve that while Giyu battles Akaza, he will use this new power to his best ability and beat the demon.

Having seen the Transparent World momentarily, Tanjiro realizes his own movement and speed had increased greatly, he was able to see how Akaza's body reacts in battle and concludes he may be able to behead him if he removes his battle spirit to avoid his senses.

Akaza begins to overwhelm Giyu, the latter having used all his Water Breathing forms only for Akaza to immediately adapt to them all and anticipate what he uses. The Upper Moon decides to finally kill him, commending the Hashira for lasting this long in battle. As Tanjiro attempts to enter the Selfless State, Giyu tries to strike the Demon's head directly. Akaza responds by dodging the blow, then using the side of his fist to break Giyu's Nichirin Sword without getting harmed. As Giyu becomes stunned at having his sword broken, Akaza farewells him before crouching down and going in to punch through his stomach.

Suddenly, Akaza's hand falls off, saving Giyu from getting hit; Tanjiro has managed to enter the Selfless State and bypass Akaza's Compass Needle. As Giyu looks on at Tanjiro's new appearance and power, Akaza's body becomes stricken with uncertainty at Tanjiro's changed aura. He deploys his final form, Technique Deployment, Final Form: Blue Silver Chaotic Afterglow. Giyu looks at this new threat and is uncertain if he can negate this with his own Dead Calm. Tanjiro however, seeing into the Transparent World again, is able to detect the attack with his increased perception and vision.

Giyu is unable to beat Akaza's new technique and is knocked back against the wall, his Water Breathing, Eleventh Form: Dead Calm unable to handle the force. The Demon commends for surviving such a large number of fatal blows and tells him, "Don't die like Kyojuro and Tanjiro, become a demon Giyu". However, the Water Hashira becomes confused, wondering how Akaza can state that he killed Tanjiro with Tanjiro standing behind him, realizing maybe he is unable to sense his partner. He mutters to Tanjiro to go for the neck, now that Akaza is unaware. Tanjiro calls out to the Upper Moon and declares he will decapitate him, annoying Giyu for announcing his attack out loud. Akaza retaliates by attempting to swipe the Demon Slayer's head, only for Tanjiro to duck down to safety. Akaza wonders how he is able to avoid his final form but assures himself that his Compass Needle will sense any attack with his battle spirit high.

Suddenly, he notices he cannot sense anything, seeing Tanjiro as completely different from before and shocking him. With his battle spirit seemingly gone, Akaza tries to calm himself and believes he will be able to sense an attack. Without warning, his head is sliced off by Tanjiro using the Hinokami Kagura: Setting Sun Transformation. With Giyu stunned at Tanjiro's feat, Akaza declares this impossible, unable to sense what happened.

Dragon Ball (Japanese: ドラゴンボール, Hepburn: Doragon Bōru) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Akira Toriyama. Originally serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from 1984 to 1995, the 519 individual chapters were printed in 42 tankōbon volumes. Dragon Ball was inspired by the Chinese novel Journey to the West and Hong Kong martial arts films. It initially had a comedy focus but later became an action-packed fighting series. The story follows the adventures of Son Goku, from childhood to adulthood, as he trains in martial arts and explores the world in search of the Dragon Balls, seven magical orbs which summon a wish-granting dragon when gathered. Along his journey, Goku makes several friends and battles villains, many of whom also seek the Dragon Balls.

The manga was adapted into two anime series produced by Toei Animation: Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z, which were broadcast in Japan from 1986 to 1996. A media franchise has built up around the series; among the merchandise, there have been both animated and live-action films, collectible trading card games, action figures, collections of soundtracks and video games. The series was licensed for an English-language release in North America and the United Kingdom by Viz Media, and in Australia and New Zealand by Madman Entertainment. The companies initially split the manga into two parts, Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z to match the anime series but the most recent edition of the series was released under its original title.

Dragon Ball has become one of the most successful manga series of all time. Its initial serialization in Weekly Shōnen Jump was partly responsible for the magazine reaching its highest circulation of 6.53 million weekly sales. Its collected tankōbon volumes have over 160 million copies sold in Japan and 260 million sold worldwide, making it the second best-selling manga series. Reviewers have praised the manga for its comedy, fight scenes, and pacing, while recognizing a coming-of-age theme and its use of cultural references from Chinese mythology and Japanese folktales. Complaints from parents in the United States resulted in English-language releases being edited to remove nudity, racial stereotypes, and other content.

Also regarded as one of the most influential manga series, Dragon Ball has inspired numerous manga artists, including Eiichiro Oda (One Piece), Masashi Kishimoto (Naruto), and Tite Kubo (Bleach). A sequel, titled Dragon Ball Super, has been published in V Jump since 2015. It is written by Toriyama and illustrated by Toyotarou.

Plot summary
See also: List of Dragon Ball characters
Son Goku, a monkey-tailed boy, and Bulma, a teenage girl, travel to find the seven Dragon Balls, which summon the dragon Shenlong to grant the user one wish. Their journey leads to the desert bandit Yamcha, who later becomes an ally; Chi-Chi, whom Goku unknowingly agrees to marry; and Pilaf, an impish man who seeks the Dragon Balls to fulfill his desire to rule the world. Goku undergoes rigorous training regimes under the martial arts master Kame-Sen'nin to fight in the Tenkaichi Budōkai (天下一武道会, lit. "Strongest Under the Heavens Martial Arts Tournament"). He becomes friends with a monk named Kuririn, his training partner and initial rival. After the tournament, Goku searches for the Dragon Ball his grandfather left him and almost single-handedly defeats the Red Ribbon Army and their hired assassin, Taopaipai. Goku then reunites with his friends to defeat the fortune teller Baba Uranai's fighters and use her to find the last Dragon Ball in order to revive a friend killed by Taopaipai.

Three years later at the Tenkaichi Budōkai, Goku and his allies oppose Kame-Sen'nin's rival and Taopaipai's brother, Tsuru-Sen'nin, and his students Tenshinhan and Chaozu. Kuririn is killed after the tournament; Goku tracks down the murderer's leader, Piccolo Daimao, but is defeated. The samurai Yajirobe takes Goku to the hermit Karin, who heals him and gives him a power boost. Meanwhile, Piccolo defeats and kills Kame-Sen'nin and Chaozu before using the Dragon Balls to regain his youth and destroy Shenlong. Goku then kills Piccolo Daimao, who, before dying, spawns his son/reincarnation Piccolo. Karin then directs Goku to Kami, the original creator of the Dragon Balls and Piccolo Daimao's other half, to restore Shenlong and revive his slain friends. Goku trains under Kami for the next three years, once again reuniting with his friends at the Tenkaichi Budōkai. There, he defeats Piccolo, whose life he spares as it would also kill Kami. Goku leaves with Chi-Chi to keep his promise to marry her.

Five years later, Goku is a young adult and father to a son, Gohan. A man named Raditz arrives on Earth, identifies Goku as his younger brother Kakarrot, and reveals to him that they are members of a nearly extinct extraterrestrial race called the Saiyans (サイヤ人, Saiya-jin), who sent Goku to conquer Earth for them; however, Goku had suffered a severe head injury as an infant and lost all memories of his mission. Goku refuses to continue the mission, and sides with Piccolo to kill Raditz at the cost of his own life. In the afterlife, Goku trains under the North Kaiō until he is revived by the Dragon Balls to save the Earth from the invading Nappa and Vegeta. In the battle, Yamcha, Chaozu, Tenshinhan, and Piccolo are killed, and the Dragon Balls cease to exist. Kuririn and the galactic tyrant Freeza learn of another set of Dragon Balls on the planet Namek (ナメック星, Namekku-sei), Piccolo's homeworld. Bulma, Gohan, and Kuririn search for them to revive their friends and restore Earth's Dragon Balls. Their goal leads to several battles with Freeza's minions and Vegeta, the latter standing alongside the heroes to fight the Ginyu Force, a team of mercenaries. The long battle with Freeza ends when Goku transforms into a legendary Super Saiyan (超サイヤ人, Sūpā Saiya-jin) and defeats him. Barely surviving, Freeza recovers and goes to Earth to take his revenge on Goku; however, he is killed by a Super Saiyan from the future named Trunks.

Three years later, a group of Androids (人造人間, Jinzōningen, lit. "Artificial Humans") created by a member of the former Red Ribbon Army, Doctor Gero, appears, seeking revenge against Goku. During this time, an evil life form called Cell also emerges and, after absorbing two of the Androids to achieve his "perfect form", holds his own fighting tournament to challenge the protagonists. After Goku sacrifices his own life to no avail, Gohan avenges his father by killing Cell. Seven years later Goku, briefly revived for one day, and his allies are drawn into a fight against Majin Boo. After many battles, including the destruction and re-creation of the Earth, a resurrected Goku destroys Boo with a Genki-Dama (a sphere of pure energy drawn from all intelligent beings on Earth) and wishes for him to be reincarnated as a "good person". Ten years later, at the Tenkaichi Budōkai, Goku meets Boo's human reincarnation, Oob. After testing his powers, Goku departs with Oob to train him to be the Earth's new guardian.


A unifying component of the plot accompanying Goku's progression as a martial artist is his search for the eponymous Dragon Balls. They are one component of the universe, but are not the focus of most of the plot lines of the title. The Dragon Balls themselves are seven magical orbs which are scattered across the world. When assembled, they can be used to summon Shenron, the dragon who will grant one wish within its limit. After the wish is granted, the Dragon Balls are scattered again across the world and become inert for one year. In times past, it would take generations to search the world and gather the Dragon Balls. At the beginning of the story, however, a 16-year-old genius girl named Bulma invents a Dragon Radar to detect the Dragon Balls and makes the process far easier than it was originally intended to be.

The story of Dragon Ball unfolds gradually over 11 years of publication. The tone and the style of the stories gradually changes to reflect the tastes of the readers and the editors of Shōnen Jump in Japan. The early volumes of the manga (chapters 1-134) are primarily humorous fantasy stories, but they contain some minor sci-fi elements, much like Dr. Slump. Notable fantasy elements include not only the monkey boy Goku and the Dragon Balls themselves, but also many talking animal characters, unlikely martial art techniques, and identifying characters as gods and demons. Despite the fantasy elements, the world does contain highly advanced technology including hoi-poi capsules, space-saving capsules which are pocket sized but can store almost any object (including cars, planes and even houses) and other "near future" objects. The overall mood of the earlier volumes is light with few deaths and an emphasis on adventure and humor.

A subtle but significant change in mood begins after Goku's best friend Krillin is killed (the first of many deaths in this arc). This begins the King Piccolo arc (chapters 135-194) in which the manga enters a darker tone compared to its earlier volumes. This arc would more or less define how later arcs would be structured.

Dragon Ball fully transforms into an action based shōnen manga at the onset of the Saiyan arc (chapters 195-241). Starting with introduction of Goku's first son (Gohan), things begin to take a much more serious and harder sci-fi approach. Many characters which were previously implied to have mystic origins, including Goku and Piccolo, are revealed to be aliens from other planets. Advanced space travel, alien threats, and powerful cyborgs and androids take center stage instead of more fantastic villains.

Super Saiyan Goku as seen in the manga (Full Color)

After the defeat of Vegeta, and the conclusion of the Saiyan arc, the survivors of the vicious Saiyan attack head off to the planet Namek to resurrect their friends. This begins the Frieza arc (chapters 242-329). The Frieza arc is noteworthy for introducing the first Super Saiyan (Goku), now a staple of the series. It also sets the tone for more awesomely powerful characters. For example, the antagonist Frieza is first said to have a "power level" (the series' futuristic measure of a fighter's speed and strength, i.e., one average human is listed as 5) of 530,000. He then transforms into a more powerful form, at which point his power level is over 1,000,000. After two subsequent transformations, he reveals that he is still only using a fraction of his full power.

The Android arc (chapters 330-420) introduces Future Trunks, a mysterious Half-Saiyan Half-Human from a destroyed future world where all of the Z Fighters are killed by evil, seemingly unstoppable war machines called Androids, and the enigmatic and villainous Cell who is made from the cells from most of the heroes as well as some of the villains. This arc is notable for being the only arc in which Goku does not defeat the main villain; instead, it is his son Gohan who defeats Cell. In this arc, Gohan surpasses the level of Super Saiyan and reaches the stage of Super Saiyan 2 in order to defeat Cell.

After Goku's death he is allowed to keep his body and train in the Other World. Seven years pass and Goku gets stronger while Gohan's power decreases. Fortuneteller Baba allows Goku to return to Earth for a single day which marks the start of the Majin Buu arc (chapters 421-519) which is the final arc of the manga. The beginning of this final arc concentrates on a teenaged Gohan. All the male Saiyans manage to reach the level of Super Saiyan at least (including fusions). Gohan can still use Super Saiyan 2, while Goku and Vegeta obtain this transformation as well. And the final level of the Super Saiyans, Super Saiyan 3, is reached by Goku, and later Gotenks. A considerable number of fusions also take place to add to the series, allowing Goten and Trunks to fuse resulting in Gotenks, Goku and Vegeta fuse to create the single most powerful character in Dragon Ball: the invincible Vegito. During this series, Majin Buu destroys earth and even manages to increase his own power by absorbing Gotenks, Piccolo and Gohan. Majin Buu also succeeds where the villains Vegeta, Frieza and Cell had previously failed and destroys Earth. Earth and everyone that was on it when it was destroyed are restored using the Namekian Dragon Balls, and Kid Buu is destroyed by Goku's Spirit Bomb only after taking on Goku, Vegeta, Mr. Satan and Good Buu.

Kid Buu was reincarnated into a human being of pure good called Uub and Goku, Vegeta, Mr. Satan and the Good Buu return to Earth and returned to Earth to reunite with their friends and families. Ten years later, Goku asks Good Buu to cheat so Goku and Uub can have a match, after the match Goku decides to go to Uub's village and train Uub to his potential so that one day they can have a match to decide who is the strongest fighter in the universe (currently Goku). Uub's village later receives money from Mr. Satan. To say goodbye the heroes that appear in the manga (excluding minor characters), everyone waves to the readers and a large "THE END" sign is seen floating.

After completing this series, Toriyama had a break before making gag manga called Nekomajin. This story features many elements and a few characters from Dragon Ball, including characters such as Majin Buu, Vegeta, and Goku.

A Korean MMORPG that serves as a follow-up to the manga, Dragon Ball Online, was developed with Bandai Namco Games and NTL. The game acts as a sequel to the manga with Akira Toriyama having supervised all aspects of the game, from storyline and setting to character and location designs. In a press conference in South Korea on February 14, 2008, Kazuhiko Torishima, the director of Shueisha at the time (and Toriyama's first editor), stated that Toriyama had immersed himself in creating character designs and providing editorial supervision for the game for the past five years. Two of the main villains of the game, Mira and Towa, were created by Akira Toriyama himself.

Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods and Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection ‘F’ have been said to be an expansion to the manga, as well as the new arcs of Dragon Ball Super, due to Toriyama's involvement in the production writing their respective scripts.

With the fate of Namek at stake, Grand Elder Guru sends the young Namekian Dende to give the important information to Krillin and Gohan about how summon Porunga, the Namekian Dragon.

Dende summons Porunga, the Namekian Dragon

As Dende finally reaches Krillin with the important message, they take the Dragon Balls from a sleeping Vegeta and head away from Frieza's spaceship. Dende summons Porunga by speaking the Namekian language. Meanwhile, back on Frieza's ship, Vegeta awakens, suddenly sensing Frieza's approaching power level and to see that the Dragon has already been summoned. Gohan, Krillin, and Dende set out to make their wish, which is to revive Yamcha, Tien Shinhan, Chiaotzu, and Piccolo. The Dragon informs them that he can only wish back one person at a time. With King Kai's help, Piccolo communicates telepathically to Gohan and asks him to restore his life. His reasoning is that if he is resurrected, Kami will return to Earth and that will also bring back Earth's Dragon Balls, in effect allowing for the others to also be revived with a wish. Piccolo asks for the second wish to teleport him to Namek, wanting to exact revenge on Frieza for killing his people despite King Kai’s objections. Gohan, Krillin, and Dende agree to this, and make the wishes.

Frieza prepares to transform

Vegeta arrives at the scene after the second wish is made. Since the first two wishes had already been used to bring Piccolo back to life and then to Namek, Vegeta wants to save the last wish for eternal life for himself. Just as Dende asks the Dragon, Guru dies, and the Dragon Balls turn to stone. Vegeta's wish is not granted, but worse yet, Frieza has arrived and is extremely angry that the Dragon Balls have already been used. Vegeta fights his former boss, gloating that he has become a Super Saiyan, but as Frieza shockingly realizes they are somewhat evenly matched, Vegeta abruptly tells him to transform and reveal his true strength. Frieza amusingly wonders how Vegeta knows this, and Vegeta tells him Zarbon spilled it out before. Frieza transforms into his second form, one that is even stronger than before, claiming that his power level has risen over a million. Frieza tells them that while most transform to increase their battle power, he does it to decrease his power, because it is so enormous it's hard to control himself. Vegeta, realizing that he underestimated Frieza's strength, is shocked.

Piccolo finds Nail

Meanwhile, Piccolo, who was just teleported to Namek by a wish, senses the fighting and heads to the battlefield. Along the way he sees the dying Nail, who informs him on what has been happening. He also requests that Piccolo fuse with him to be more of a challenge to Frieza. At first, Piccolo is reluctant, but after Nail assures him that his personality will not change by fusing, Piccolo decides to accept, increasing his strength and speed tremendously.

Frieza defeats Gohan with ease

Back on the battlefield, Frieza's new power level is said by him to be over one million. He also tells Vegeta about the destruction of the planet Vegeta and his father. Vegeta simply scoffs at this, saying that he surpassed his father when he was a child. After fully transforming, he impales Krillin with his horns, who was trying to protect Dende, and tosses him to the sea. Gohan tries to save him, but when Frieza stops him, an incredibly angry Gohan easily beats down Frieza and pummels him with many ki blasts. Despite Vegeta's shocked reaction, the attack is not enough and Frieza recovers with little damage done. Luckily, Dende rescued Krillin out of the sea, telling Gohan that he is still alive. Angry that he was actually was hurt by the attack, Frieza then easily pounds Gohan, hurting him severely. Vegeta tries to attack when Frieza's back is turned, but it is completely ineffective, and Gohan is left almost dead. Gohan is saved when Krillin launches a Destructo Disc at Frieza and cuts off his tail. Dende then uses this time to heal Gohan as Vegeta watches. It was revealed that Dende was the one who plucked Krillin out of the sea and healed him. Krillin continues to distract Frieza using many evasive maneuvers, such as Solar Flare. Soon, Gohan is healed and now stronger than ever due to his Saiyan genes.

PiccoloVsFriezaNV01
Piccolo takes on Frieza

Just then, Piccolo arrives, claiming that he can beat Frieza. Vegeta scoffs at Piccolo, claiming that reviving him was a waste of a wish. However, this turns to shock for Vegeta that the Namekian who was easily killed by Nappa had now become powerful enough to challenge Frieza. The fight begins as Piccolo remains confident that he can take Frieza down. Thanks to his fusion with Nail, his power is slightly higher than that of Frieza's. Through much of the battle, Piccolo has the upper hand, but Frieza transforms again into his third stage, earning yet another power increase.

Crazy Finger Beam
Frieza fires an array of blasts

Piccolo, still confident that his speed is greater than Frieza's, is quickly proved wrong when Frieza grossly outstrips him in both power and speed, and subsequently launches finger blasts at him that are too fast for him to dodge as he is unable to even see the blasts. Soon, Piccolo is severely wounded and helpless against Frieza. Gohan, furious at the torture that Piccolo is receiving explodes in a bout of rage, revealing his hidden powers as he once again takes on Frieza.

KrillinImpaleBeam
Krillin blasts a hole through Vegeta

Gohan then launches a Wild Rush Blaster that proves to be challenging for Frieza, until he deflects it back. Luckily, Piccolo saves Gohan in the nick of time with a blast. Frieza realizes that Gohan is a Saiyan and that he and Vegeta are constantly getting stronger. He then decides to transform into his final and strongest form, his original being. Vegeta comes up with the idea for Krillin to blast him to near death and for Dende to heal him afterwards, increasing his power enough to become a Super Saiyan. Although Krillin is highly reluctant at first, he blasts Vegeta in the stomach, piercing him through. Because of Saiyan heritage, recovery from a near-death experience causes Vegeta to increase in strength significantly. While Frieza transforms, Dende heals Piccolo and reluctantly heals Vegeta. Vegeta becomes confident that he has become a Super Saiyan.

Another Transformation - Frieza & Fighters
Frieza in his Final Form

Frieza sees how everyone was defying death using Dende's healing, so he takes to the root of the problem. After transforming, he quickly kills Dende with a Death Beam, meaning the fighters will have no more chances to be healed. He tries to blast Gohan as well, but Vegeta quickly saves him. A confident Vegeta decides to commence battle with Frieza and his newfound power. To his horror, no matter what Vegeta does, he is no match and Frieza still has the upper hand throughout the whole battle. Vegeta actually sheds a tear in frustration when he realizes that the situation is hopeless. Because he drops all his defenses in desperation, Frieza batters him mercilessly to the brink of death.

Vegeta meets his end at the hands of Frieza

Goku, still in the Medical Machine, awakens and realizes what is taking place and quickly rushes off to save his comrades. As Goku arrives, Vegeta swallows his pride and tells Frieza that Goku is the legendary Super Saiyan that will kill him. Frieza gets angry and blasts a hole using his Death Beam through Vegeta's heart. Before his death, with tears in his eyes, he tells Goku the truth of Planet Vegeta's destruction, how every Saiyan was forced to serve Frieza before most of them were killed, how Frieza took Vegeta from his father when he was a child and threaten to kill him unless he followed orders, how Frieza killed the king anyway along with Goku's parents and the Saiyan Race. In his last breath, Vegeta asks Goku to take vengeance for all Saiyans, and Goku then buries Vegeta. Fueled with rage at Vegeta's death, Goku honors Vegeta's request to take vengeance for Planet Vegeta and the entire Saiyan race and begins to fight Frieza.

Goku vs. Frieza
KaiokenNamek
Goku uses the Kaio-ken x20

The battle between Frieza and Goku begins. They seem perfectly equivalent for some time in terms of strength and speed. During the match, Goku seems to have more clever ideas on how to fight and tricks Frieza several times. Goku used to his advantage the fact that Frieza needs to see his opponent and is unable to feel their energy. While Goku was under water during one attack, he used the Kamehameha wave as torpedoes to trick Frieza. Frieza then revealed that he was only using about a fraction of his power, and that he'll power up to 50%, which turns the tables in Frieza's favor. At Kaio-ken x10, Goku was being brutally beaten. Frieza claimed he allowed Goku to think he had a chance, and even offered for Goku to replace Ginyu as his bodyguard. Goku refused, but after one rigorous attack after another, Piccolo, Gohan, Krillin, and even King Kai began to see the situation as hopeless. Goku tries to raise his power using the Kaio-ken x20 and shoot a Kaio-ken Kamehameha at Frieza, but it only leaves Frieza's hands burnt, while the attack left Goku completely drained.

Goku endures Frieza's wrath

Having no choice, Goku prepares the Spirit Bomb in desperation. Piccolo, Gohan, and Krillin step in to try and hold off Frieza while Goku gathers energy for the attack. Once the Spirit Bomb is finally finished and unleashed upon Frieza, it does significant damage to him, causing the Z Warriors to believe Frieza was finished off. Krillin and Gohan take Goku and Piccolo away from the damage. A few minutes of celebration was soon turned into a horrid sight once Krillin saw Frieza furiously standing on the top of a rock.

Goku transforms into a Super Saiyan after witnessing Krillin's murder at the hands of Frieza

Enraged and surprised that Goku had such ability for a Saiyan, Frieza lashes out against the other warriors. He first decides to kill Goku. As he fires a Death Beam at the exhausted Saiyan, Piccolo jumps in the way of the blast and saves his life (however, in the manga, Frieza simply blasts at Piccolo with a Death Beam). Though it does not kill him, Piccolo is hurt very badly and falls to the ground unconscious, enraging Goku. Next, Frieza kills Krillin by making his whole body explode in the air. Seeing his best friend killed causes Goku to erupt with even more rage. In a display of gathering energy, the angry Goku pulls out his strongest emotions ever before reached. His hair turns spikier and golden, and his eyes turn dark green. He is now a Super Saiyan, a legendary class of Saiyan, with his power tremendously increased. He tells Gohan to take Piccolo and retrieve Bulma and take them to the ship that he traveled in and use it to head back to Earth and get as far from Namek as possible.

Goku Double Axe Handles Frieza

Super Saiyan Goku and Frieza begin to fight, and Goku toys with him and starts treating him as if he was a rag doll. With no other options, Frieza decides that if he cannot beat Goku, then he'll blow up Namek instead. He throws a ball of energy towards the planet's core, hoping to destroy the planet. However, Frieza realizes he held back too much power, and the planet only begins to crumble. Frieza then claims it will explode in a few minutes and reveals that he can breathe in space. As the battle rages on, Frieza decides to use 100% of his full power. Though this significantly increases his power level and allows Frieza to gain the upper hand on Goku for a time, the damaged incurred in these previous levels causes him to lose that power radically after a short bout. Goku realizes this and uses it to his advantage to take down the mighty tyrant.

Back on Earth, Kami and Mr. Popo gathered all of the Dragon Balls, which joys the Z fighters at King Kai's place as it means Piccolo is alive, and with King Kai's help they devise a plan to bring back all who were killed by Frieza and his army.

Vegeta Laughs
Vegeta laughs upon seeing the Super Saiyan

Since the wish brings back Guru, who was killed by the grief of Frieza's killings, King Kai telepathically asks him to wish all of those on Namek, except for Frieza, back to Earth with Porunga, who still has one wish remaining. However, Goku intercepts their telepathic communication and requests that he be left behind on Namek as well to ensure Frieza's truly destroyed, and King Kai and Guru reluctantly give in. King Kai notices that Super Saiyan Goku is no longer the Goku they used to know; he is now only acting on blind Saiyan instincts. Vegeta, who was also resurrected as well by the wish, is surprised to see that Goku had become a Super Saiyan just before he is teleported off of Namek.

FriezaSlicedByOwnAttackNV
Frieza is sliced by his own attack

With the entire planet empty except Goku and Frieza, they take the battle around the crumbling planet. Soon, Goku notices that Frieza is losing stamina too much to be a match for him. He then stops that fight and begins to leave, telling Frieza to train and come back for a rematch. Enraged, Frieza decides to release a Death Saucer that he can direct to attack Goku with. Goku easily outmaneuvers this attack. Frieza realizes that one is not enough and releases another Death Disc, attempting to outsmart Goku. Goku maneuvers at the last minute, blasting into the ground creating a blinding blanket of dust. Frieza is unable to detect energy without physically seeing it, so one makes its way to cut Frieza in half. Goku tries to warn him, but he is chopped into four pieces by the disc. As he is dying, Frieza begs Goku not to leave him like this. Goku cannot stand seeing a life, even one as evil as Frieza's, suffer in such a painful and humiliating manner. Eventually Goku takes pity on the pathetic tyrant and gave him some of his energy. Frieza then explains that there is no way Goku is going to live, as the planet is about to explode, and his ship is in no working condition. As Goku leaves, Frieza makes one final attempt to kill him, using the energy given to him to throw a wave of energy at him. Goku pushes the blast back at Frieza with his own energy blast and flies away.

Knowing he will not reach his own ship in time, Goku searches for Frieza's and finds it in a crater. Goku, frustrated and desperate, realizes that he will not make it off of Namek as he watches its wreckage plummet into a lava filled chasm. Seconds later, Goku screams in agony and rage as planet Namek disappears from the Universe in a colossal, blinding explosion.

On Earth, Dende heals Piccolo and realizes that he has merged with Nail. The Namekian Dragon Balls follows Guru to Earth, evading the explosion. As Guru is dying once more, he transfers his role as Senior Elder to Moori, a trusted Namekian village leader, so the Dragon Balls will not die with him, leading to a tearful and emotional goodbye. Dende also informs Gohan that the Namekian Dragon Balls can also resurrect a deceased person more than once. This is good news since it would mean that they could resurrect Krillin, Chiaotzu, and Goku, who had been killed before. Everyone is thrilled until King Kai reminds them that Krillin and Goku cannot be resurrected because the planet they died on (Namek) was destroyed, and if wished back, they would only appear in empty space and immediately die again from lack of air. However, Vegeta suggests that they use a wish to transport their remains to Earth first. (Although he’s only doing this because he wants Goku to show him how to become a Super Saiyan).

Porunga is summoned

130 days later (one Namek year), the Namekian Dragon Balls are able to be used again. They are first used to transport Goku, and Krillin's remains to Earth. However, Porunga reveals that he is unable to transport Goku's remains because he is not actually dead. After the second wish is used to bring back Krillin, the final wish is made to bring Goku to Earth, but Porunga then informs them that Goku refuses to come back and will return later by himself. Master Roshi thinks that Goku is afraid of seeing Chi-Chi again and Chi-Chi brings out a sword, making Roshi nervous. This leaves our heroes greatly perplexed but arrive at the conclusion that Goku is coming home either way, and they accept his absence. All, that is, except Vegeta, who leaves in a spaceship to search the universe for Goku and the key to becoming a Super Saiyan. With one wish remaining, it is used to resurrect Yamcha.

Another 130 days later, the Namekian Dragon Balls are ready again. The first two wishes are to resurrect Tien and Chiaotzu, and the final wish is to transport the Nameks to a New Namek that would have similar living conditions to their old planet Namek. Gohan and Dende share a tearful goodbye as the Nameks disappear to their new home, Gohan returns to his studies under his mother while Piccolo promises to aid Gohan in times of need. and life on Earth returns to normal... for now.

The narrator ends the saga by stating that Goku's family and friends' gazes stars each night hoping for Goku's arrival.

The plot of the Androids Saga is closely tied to that of Dragon Ball, the anime series that preceded Dragon Ball Z. An organization known as the Red Ribbon Army seeks to obtain the Dragon Balls. The main hero of the series, Goku, is still a child in Dragon Ball and embarks upon a quest to find the Dragon Balls himself. This leads to conflict between the Red Ribbon Army and Goku. As part of their plan to collect the Dragon Balls, the Red Ribbon Army employs Dr. Gero as their head scientist. Dr. Gero proceeds to construct a series of powerful Androids. Although, only in the Dragon Ball anime version, Dr. Flappe is presented as the Androids' creator, he is later revealed to be only the co-creator of Android 8. Goku is eventually forced to destroy the Red Ribbon organization in order to protect the Dragon Balls, inciting Dr. Gero to seek revenge upon him.

Dr. Gero goes unmentioned in Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z until the Trunks Saga, in which the titular character Future Trunks warns Goku that Dr. Gero survived the attacks to Red Ribbon when Goku was a child and has created a new set of Androids intent upon destroying the Earth. Future Trunks also reveals that Goku will die from an incurable heart disease before he has the chance to confront the Androids. Future Trunks then presents Goku with medicine from the future that will cure his otherwise fatal disease. He also mentions that Future Vegeta and Future Bulma are his parents, which shocks Goku. Piccolo hears the conversation between Goku and Future Trunks due to his exceptional ears. After delivering his doomsday warnings, Future Trunks returns to his own future in a Time Machine and the Dragon Team begin three years of training for the upcoming battle against the androids.

Battle with Android 19 and Android 20
Androids appear
Android 19 and Android 20 (Dr. Gero)

Three years after Future Trunks had warned Goku about the Androids' arrival, the Z Fighters go to the city where Future Trunks told them the Androids would appear, Sasebo. Goku, Gohan, and Piccolo meet Krillin halfway to Sasebo and they see the differences in their powers. On an island nearby, they meet up with Yamcha, Tien Shinhan, and Bulma who is carrying a baby. Goku tells her to leave for her own safety, but she says she wants to see the androids and then will leave. Krillin asks about the baby and Gohan assumes it is Yamcha's. Yamcha says that he is not the father. Goku says that Vegeta is the father and the baby's name is Trunks, much to Krillin and Gohan's surprise. Bulma asks how he knew because she has not told anyone yet, but he laughs it off. Piccolo asks where Vegeta is. Bulma does not know because they are not living together but says he has been training intensely for this day. They have thirty minutes to spare, so Krillin and Gohan entertain Trunks. When 10:00 comes and goes, the Z Fighters are suspicious. Gohan says that androids do not have a ki so they cannot sense them. Yajirobe arrives with Senzu Beans from Korin and leaves after refusing to fight. Seconds later, Yajirobe's hovercar explodes. The Z Fighters spot two figures lurking in the smoke from the blast. The figures race down into the city so fast that none of the fighters can see what they look like. As the Z Fighters cannot sense the Android's ki, they split up and go down into the city to find them.

Yamcha makes his way to one of the lower cities where he encounters the Androids. The Androids resemble people, so they go undetected by Yamcha. Android 20 reveals himself as an Android by grabbing Yamcha by the mouth and draining the majority of his energy. There are two of them, Android 19 and Android 20. As Yamcha struggles, Android 20 punches him through his chest, severely wounding him.

Android 20 destroys most of the island

Goku and the others, who sense Yamcha's life force disappearing, arrive shortly after, finding the Androids and Yamcha, who is laying on the ground, dying. Goku asks Krillin to evacuate Yamcha and get him a Senzu Bean before it is too late. The Androids are eager to fight, but Goku tells them that there are too many innocent people around. Android 20 decides to "fix" the problem by using his eye lasers to destroy every living thing nearby. This infuriates Goku, who then throws a punch at Android 20. Android 20 seems unaffected by the impact. Goku and the others convince the Androids to move away from the city in order to fight without harming anymore innocent bystanders. After Yamcha is completely healed with a Senzu Bean, he follows Krillin and Gohan to find the others.

Android 19 dodges Goku's punch

They come to a deserted, rocky area and Goku offers to fight first. However, Goku is clearly not his usual confident self, as he appears to already be tired and out of breath just from flying to this location. It becomes apparent that Goku is experiencing some mild effects from the heart virus, which take its toll six months later than Future Trunks had predicted. Regardless, he decides to fight Android 19, and transforms into a Super Saiyan. Android 20 is surprised by this transformation because, while he spied on Goku's battle with Vegeta and earlier, he did not observe the battles that took place on Namek, including the colossal battle between Goku and Frieza in which Goku achieved Super Saiyan for the first time. However, Android 20, unaware of the extraordinary powers of Super Saiyans, claims it is just a "minor setback" and believes that Android 19 will still be able to defeat Goku. He then seems to be proven wrong when Goku and Android 19 engage in battle, as Goku's Super Saiyan strength and speed is superior to that of Android 19. Goku seems to have the upper hand during the beginning of the battle. Meanwhile, the Z Fighters watch the fight from below. Krillin, Tien, and Yamcha cheer Goku on, believing that he will easily win against the Android. However, Gohan and Piccolo sense that something is wrong, and they notice that something is taking away from Goku's energy. He increasingly becomes more tired and out of breath, greatly lacking the power and energy of his usual self.

Piccolo Shot by Gero
Piccolo shot in the chest by Android 20

The fight continues and Goku's condition rapidly deteriorates, as his punches and kicks seem to have little effect on Android 19. Goku struggles to create a Kamehameha, which Android 19 absorbs with his hand. Piccolo then warns Goku not to use any energy blasts against the Androids. Goku gets weaker by the minute and expresses that he feels like he is dying. He clutches his hand to his chest, and at this point, Gohan realizes that the heart virus is attacking him. Krillin then gives Goku a Senzu Bean, but it has no effect against the virus, and Goku's condition continues to worsen. Android 19 takes advantage of this apparent weakness, hitting Goku with several kicks and punches before knocking him to the floor. Android 19 then sits on top of Goku, wrapping his hand around Goku's neck in order to drain him of his energy. The Z Fighters try to help him but Android 20 blocks their path. Goku lays dying as his energy is drained by the Android, until Vegeta makes his appearance on the battlefield and interferes, blindsiding Android 19 with a powerful kick to the face. Vegeta scolds Goku for fighting in his condition and kicks him towards Piccolo and the others. The Z Fighters decide that Yamcha should take Goku home, while Vegeta takes over the fight.

Android 19 struggles against Super Saiyan Vegeta

Vegeta surprises everyone when he reveals his newfound ability to turn Super Saiyan: like Goku, Vegeta's eyes turn green, and his hair turn a golden yellow. However, confident after defeating Super Saiyan Goku, Android 19 believes that he can easily defeat Vegeta, claiming that he already knows all of his moves. However, Vegeta laughs at these claims, mocking the fact that Dr. Gero did not observe the battles that took place on Namek (Vegeta quips: "Your bonehead creator picked a fine chapter to omit from your memory bank"). Vegeta then toys with Android 19, allowing the Android to punch him in the face so that he can laugh at how weak the Android is. Vegeta then proves himself superior to the Android in both strength and speed. He easily overpowers Android 19, until the Android catches him off guard, wrapping his hands around Vegeta's wrists. He begins to drain Vegeta's energy, but Vegeta remains smiling and confident, placing his feet against the Android's head and forcing it back while pulling his arms. Android 19 is able to absorb a substantial amount of energy until Vegeta rips his arms off. The Android then runs away in fear, and Vegeta blasts him with a Big Bang Attack, which destroys him easily. After the destruction of Android 19, Vegeta is naturally quite drained, but bluffs Android 20 into thinking he is still capable of taking him out. Android 20, seeing the death of Android 19 as proof, easily takes the bait and is scared off. Vegeta eats a Senzu Bean and chases after him.

Piccolo battles Android 20, severing his energy-absorption right arm

Android 20 distracts Vegeta, and promptly flees the battle. Hiding out in various canyons and behind rock faces, Android 20 is stalked by the relentlessly pursuing Z Fighters at a range of canyons. However, they struggle to find him, as they are unable to sense the power levels of Androids. Android 20 hides, while Vegeta, becoming more and more frustrated, throws a Ki Blast into the canyon, hoping to clear it away. This works to Android 20's advantage, as he reveals himself to absorb the Ki Blast and then flees once more. Android 20 then plans to absorb the energy of all the weaker fighters in order to power himself up and beat Vegeta. He deduces that Piccolo is the strongest next to Vegeta and sneaks up on him from behind. He holds him in his grasp with his hand over Piccolo's mouth, draining his energy. Piccolo alerts Gohan telepathically and Gohan hits Android 20 with a Double Axe Handle, removing him from Piccolo's back. Piccolo then eats a Senzu Bean and challenges Android 20 to a fight. He gains the upper hand of the fight, beating Android 20 with several powerful blows and ripping the Android's arm off so that he cannot absorb any more energy. At that point, Android 20 realizes that even with his newly absorbed energy, he still is not strong enough to defeat Piccolo, someone who should be nothing compared to him according to his data. Piccolo informs him that they had all been training for their arrival for the past three years. This comes as a surprise to Android 20, and he knows that he must return to his laboratory to repair himself in order to survive.

Plane Blasted
Android 20's Photon Wave hits Bulma's plane

Future Trunks then arrives and is shocked to discover that Androids 19 and 20 are not the same Androids from the future that he warned the Z Fighters about three years ago. Naturally, this surprises everyone. Piccolo calls Trunks by his name, and it is at this point that Vegeta realizes the boy from the future is in fact his son's future self. Vegeta also understands how Future Trunks was able to become a Super Saiyan even though there were only three Saiyans left in existence (Gohan being half-Saiyan). Bulma, Yajirobe, and baby Trunks then arrive in an aircraft, and Bulma notices Android 20. While everyone's attention is diverted to Bulma, Android 20 takes the opportunity to escape, but not before claiming that he will now proceed to activate two more Androids, 17 and 18. He then blows up the landscape with a powerful Photon Wave, which further distracts everyone.

Bulma panics, wondering where her infant child is

Bulma's aircraft is blown up, but she and baby Trunks are saved by Future Trunks. Future Trunks is angry that Vegeta, the one closest to them, did not seem to notice nor care about the life-threatening danger Bulma and the baby were subjected to. Future Trunks then confronts his father, demanding to know why he did not try to save Bulma and his son. Vegeta spitefully replies, "I have more important things to worry about than that foolish woman and her blasted child!" and continues to look around for the Android, angry that he was able to disappear from sight again. when he is unable to find him, Vegeta goes back to the group. Bulma retaliates at Vegeta for being uncaring when she says that he makes Trunks cry every time he sticks his "geeky face" up to him, much to Krillin and Gohan's amusement. Bulma then recalls seeing Dr. Gero's picture in one of her father's science magazines, revealing that Android 20 is actually Dr. Gero and that he rebuilt himself into an Android as his human body became older and weak. Bulma also remembers reading about the location of Dr. Gero's laboratory, just north of North City. The Z Fighters then plot to find the lab and destroy it before Dr. Gero can activate the other two Androids. However, Vegeta says that that is a cowardly move, proudly claiming that they should allow the Androids to be activated so that he can defeat them all by himself. Future Trunks warns Vegeta to never underestimate the power of the Androids, but Vegeta refuses to listen and flies off. Future Trunks chases after him to prevent his father from suffering his predicted death. After hearing him call Vegeta "father", Gohan and Krillin are confused, so Piccolo reveals that Future Trunks is the person the baby will grow up to be. While Gohan and Krillin are shocked, Bulma is only relieved that Trunks will not look like Vegeta as an adult.

Dr. Gero with Androids 17 and 18 after he awakened them from their chambers

The Z Fighters then pursue Dr. Gero to his lab, but arrive too late, as he has already activated his most recent yet unstable creations, the lethal siblings Android 17 and Android 18. Future Trunks wants to destroy them before they are activated, having already seen the damage that the two Androids' future counterparts have done in his timeline. However, much to his dismay, Vegeta says wants to fight them, as they might be a good challenge to him. Dr. Gero knows of their inability to follow orders directly and had built an emergency Shut Down Remote to subdue the Androids whenever they become out of control. However, since the Androids are so powerful and wise, they easily snatch the remote from him. They make their way to another one of Dr. Gero's creations and decide to unleash this incomplete monster going by the name Android 16. Dr. Gero is furious, and yells at them with increasing intensity to not activate Android 16, as its awakening might kill them all. Android 17 and Android 18 do not listen to him, and Android 17 betrays and effortlessly kills Dr. Gero. At this point, in his Super Saiyan form, Future Trunks snaps and launches a full power Buster Cannon at the Androids, destroying the whole lab and the surrounding mountainside. This does not faze them at all, and Android 17 and Android 18 then awaken Android 16, who states that his main purpose is to kill Goku.

Androids 16, 17, and 18 leave the site of Dr. Gero's lab in order to begin their search for Goku. The Z Fighters concede that they will be easily overpowered by the Androids, except for Vegeta, who is eager to test his strength against them. Vegeta is confident that, being a Super Saiyan, the Androids will be no match for him. Future Trunks warns him once again not to underestimate the Androids, demanding that they should all wait until Goku gets better before confronting them. However, Vegeta is angered by this suggestion, punching Future Trunks in the stomach. He then takes off to find the Androids by himself. Meanwhile, the three Androids stop at a mountainside road and wait for a car to pass by so that they can steal it, in order to have some fun during their search for Goku Android 16 remains quiet at first, responding only when Goku is mentioned. Peculiarly, he stands like a statue at the edge of the road, observing nature and the birds. When Vegeta arrives Android 17 suggests that Android 16 should test out his strength against him, but 16 refuses, claiming that he will fight no one but Goku, as he was programmed to do. Vegeta stands confidently, boasting his strength and challenging to send the Androids "back to the scrap heap." Android 18 becomes annoyed by Vegeta, claiming that he talks too much, and they begin to fight.

Android18DefeatsVegeta
Android 18 breaks Vegeta's arm

At first, it seems that Android 18 is no match for Vegeta, which shocks Future Trunks and the Z Fighters, but it soon becomes apparent that Android 18 is only toying with him. However, not being one to give up, Vegeta continues to fight and get beaten, thinking that he could tire her out. It becomes evident, that these two Androids, in fact, do not tire out or run out of energy, as they were built with almost unlimited internal power sources. Eventually Android 18 ends the battle by breaking Vegeta's arm with a kick. Android 17 comes and tells the Z Fighters that no one should interfere in the match, or he will fight them as well. Regardless, Future Trunks jumps in to help his beaten father, but is taken out with one hit from Android 17. The others, having no choice, rush them as well only to be taken out without effort. Vegeta's determination does not pull through when Android 18 breaks his other arm finally rendering him unconscious. This leaves only Krillin, who did not fight due to fear, unscathed.

Krillinand18
Android 18 kisses a terrified Krillin

Krillin tries to reason with the Androids that Goku had done nothing to them and that going after him would be morally wrong. Android 17 then explains to Krillin that finding Goku is a game. Android 16 also says that he was programmed to kill Goku. Then Android 16 and Android 17 go off to find Goku but not before telling Krillin that if anyone else wants to face them again, they would gladly accept a rematch. Android 18 then kisses Krillin, and they fly off. Krillin wonders if the Androids are as evil as Future Trunks warned but puts that aside and quickly heals the others, with the remaining Senzu Beans. Vegeta gets back to his feet and dusts himself off. His pride keeping him from admitting his inferior power, he flies off angrily. Future Trunks realizes that the Androids in the time period are far stronger than their counterparts in his own time, as he was able to fight them evenly for a time there. Piccolo comes to a realization that they do not have enough time to train, and the only way for him to get strong enough is to become one being with Kami. He does not admit any of this to the others though and tries to fool them into thinking he is still the evil King Piccolo by making idle threats and then flying off. Krillin is not fooled though, and instantly makes the realization that Piccolo is going to the Lookout to fuse with him. He would then become one with Kami as they used to be long ago.

Piccolo arrives at the Lookout, demanding that they fuse together so that he will have the power to defeat the Androids. At first, Kami is unsure about the fusion, and Piccolo becomes angry. He proceeds to sit down, waiting for Kami to make his decision. A short amount of time passes and Kami notices that Earth is now being threatened by an even greater force than the Androids. He has known about the existence of this threat for the past four years, and it has now emerged, terrorizing thousands of people. Kami then agrees to fuse with Piccolo, and they remain using Piccolo's body. Nevertheless, they rejoin, and regain the identity that they had lost long ago as well as Kami's vast wisdom and knowledge, becoming a Super Namek. Because of the fusion, the Dragon Balls and Shenron cease to exist. This is a problem that is later solved. With the knowledge of the new creature, Piccolo goes to investigate the threat.

Trunks and Gohan come back to Kame House

Krillin calls Capsule Corporation to tell Bulma that they are moving Goku to Kame House and Bulma tells them of a shocking discovery, another time machine that looks like the same one Future Trunks came in. Future Trunks is shocked because there is only one time machine in existence which is the one, he has in his pocket as a capsule. She faxes over a picture of the other time machine and Future Trunks and Gohan go meet her to examine it. When they get to the place where the picture was taken, Future Trunks confirms that it was his machine. However, it looked aged with moss and had damage to the dome, damage showing that someone or something blasted its way out. Soon Gohan discovers an exoskeleton of some disgusting looking creature, and Bulma finds eggshells. Soon, all the Z Fighters sense strange and familiar power levels from far away. Also, there is a news report depicting that a local suburban district, Gingertown's population of 15,000 that completely vanished. All that was revealed was scattered clothing about everywhere and signs of a struggle.

The source of the power levels, Future Trunks' aged time machine and the disappearances finally reveals himself as a hideous humanoid creature with insect qualities. The creature explains how the people of Gingertown all disappeared; by sucking the bio matter of a human with his unique tail, reducing him to nothing in front of Piccolo's eyes. Piccolo instantly confronts him, and they fight. Meanwhile, Android 16 detects two enormous powers fighting with his power radar and tells the other two that one of the powers is equal to Android 17 himself. Android 17 bluffs this and believes that Android 16's power radar is broken, and they drive off, foreshadowing things to come.

PiccoloVsImperfectCell
Piccolo battles Cell

Piccolo's strength is clear in this fight, he completely dominates the creature but is stunned with surprise when it shoots a Kamehameha wave at him. Distracted, Piccolo's arm is absorbed into a sagging mound of flesh, and he admits defeat while asking it who it is and how it made it here. The monster then goes on to reveal that its name was Cell, and how he was created by Dr. Gero as the perfect fighting android made up of the cells of the universe's strongest warriors. However, Dr. Gero saw the plan to create the ultimate bio soldier was taking too long so he abandoned the project. Instead, the supercomputer in charge of the project continued the project secretly. A special robot was created to capture the gene samples of Goku, Vegeta and Piccolo when they were fighting on Earth; Frieza and King Cold's genes were captured when they came to Earth and were killed by Future Trunks. Many others fell into that category too and that he had learned many of their strongest techniques and abilities. Future Trunks' genes were not collected though, as enough Saiyan samples were collected. However, Imperfect Cell reveals his most disturbing fact, that his true purpose was to absorb the unique Infinite power cores of Android 17 and Android 18, reaching his Perfect Form. With the Earth's population low in his future, and Android 17 and Android 18 destroyed, Imperfect Cell decided to steal Future Trunks' Time Machine by killing another version of Future Trunks and come back to this time, to a fresher planet with more victims. Cell believes that its time to end the fight, as Piccolo thinks he has enough information and reveals that he was bluffing the whole time by regenerating his arm back. Cell is angry at being tricked, as Piccolo vows to stop him.

CellSolarFlare
Cell uses the Solar Flare to escape

Despite Imperfect Cell absorbing a lot of energy from Piccolo's arm, he realizes that he is no match for Piccolo at all and it is only made worse when Future Trunks and Krillin arrive as well. Imperfect Cell recognizes Future Trunks as the boy he killed in his own timeline and realizes that this Future Trunks must be from another alternate timeline. He also learns from Krillin that Goku is still alive as well and uses his Solar Flare technique to blind everyone and runs away, masking his power to be as undetectable by the others. Just then Cell notices Vegeta, who sensing a great ki, travels to Gingertown and is shocked when it comes from Piccolo. He is updated on how the Namekian got stronger.

Tien arrives shortly after as Piccolo explains the situation of Cell to Vegeta and the others who all have unique reactions; Trunks is shocked by another android, Krillin is dismayed at the threat he poses, and Vegeta is angry that everything is surpassing him, the Saiyan Prince. Vegeta then vows to surpass the limits of Super Saiyan and flies off. Future Trunks and Krillin, leave to destroy the Imperfect Cell that is probably growing in this timeline to prevent another Imperfect Cell later.

Meanwhile, Piccolo and Tien search desperately for Imperfect Cell, knowing that he has hidden his ki and is ever getting stronger by absorbing more victims.

Piccolo vs. Android 17
Back in the mountain region, the Androids are joyriding their way to Goku's House. Goku is then moved to Master Roshi's house. The Androids reach Goku's home and find that it is completely empty, so they proceed to the next likely place for him to be, Kame House.

Burning Storm
Future Trunks destroys Dr. Gero's lab

Future Trunks and Krillin return to the site of Dr. Gero's laboratory, this time discovering a secret laboratory hidden underground. Here, they find the Cell of the present in his larval/baby form, infantile and weak, his growth and development maintained only by the master computer. They also discover Dr. Gero's blueprints which outline the design of Android 17. Future Trunks, eager to take the opportunity to find any weakness of the Androids, takes the blueprints before he and Krillin incinerate the baby Cell and the supercomputer with Ki Blasts. Krillin then destroys the laboratory they were in. Future Trunks instructs Krillin to bring the blueprints to Bulma at Capsule Corporation so that she can examine them, as he plans to go looking for his father, Vegeta, in order to train with him and learn to become an Ascended Saiyan as well. However, Krillin warns Future Trunks that Vegeta is very independent and may prefer to train alone.

Meanwhile, Cell is ravaging through cities, depleting the population as he absorbs energy from every human, he can find in order to become stronger. Piccolo, Krillin, and Tien continue to search for Cell, but he remains one step ahead of them, hiding in the shadows as he knows that he is not yet powerful enough to defeat Piccolo.

Gohan,Goku,FutureTrunksAndVegeta
The Saiyans on The Lookout

Back at Kame House, Goku has been resting in the upstairs bedroom as the antidote slowly cures him of the heart virus. At one point, Chi-Chi goes to check up on Goku and discovers his bed empty. She looks out the window and finds Goku healthy and fully restored, testing his ki blasts across the ocean. Goku and the others (Chi-Chi and Master Roshi) exchange heartfelt greetings that he is fully awake again, and Goku explains that he overheard everyone talking about the situation while he was asleep. He then says his goodbyes and uses Instant Transmission to teleport to the aircraft where the Z Fighters are. After everyone is happy that Goku's well again, Goku himself states that in his current state, he is no match for either the Androids or Imperfect Cell. Because of this, he plans to enter the Hyperbolic Time Chamber with Gohan, where they can spend a whole year training in the span of one day in real time, in order to surpass the powers of a Super Saiyan. Goku and Gohan then proceed to find Future Trunks and Vegeta in the mountains. Future Trunks tells Goku that Vegeta refuses to train with him, and that he has been standing on a rock cliff for three days straight, trying to figure out how to ascend passed the level of a Super Saiyan. Goku approaches Vegeta and tells him about the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, stating that only two people can enter the Chamber at once. Goku will be going in with Gohan, leaving Vegeta to train with Trunks. Eager at the chance to complete a year's worth of training in one day, Vegeta accepts the offer and demands to go first. The four of them then proceed to Kami's Lookout where Mr. Popo leads them to the Hyperbolic Time Chamber. Vegeta and Future Trunks enter the Chamber first, and Goku and Gohan wait outside the door for a day.

The androids confront Piccolo on an island nearby Kame House

As Future Trunks and Vegeta train in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, Piccolo is at the Kame House, watching the news and cursing Imperfect Cell while the others are taking a nap. However, Android 16, Android 17 and Android 18 suddenly arrive in front of Kame House. Piccolo is surprised to see them and awakens the others. The Androids ask the Z Fighters where Goku is, but they refuse to tell. Piccolo then challenges Android 17 to a fight, and they move to a deserted island nearby. Piccolo requests that the other two Androids stay out of the fight, and Android 17 agrees. However, Android 17 doesn't realize that Piccolo has fused with Kami (which essentially granted him the powers of a Super Namek). Because of this, Android 17 underestimates him and is knocked down easily at first. Android 16 then warns Android 17 that Piccolo is much stronger than before. The battle becomes more serious as the two give it their all and are evenly matched in power, with Piccolo gaining a slight advantage with his new techniques. Meanwhile, Imperfect Cell, still absorbing energy from humans in a nearby city, notices Piccolo's huge ki and deduces that he must be fighting the Androids. He then rushes full speed to them, finally seeing a chance to absorb the Androids and achieve his perfect form. After intense fighting, Android 17 states that Piccolo won't be able to keep this up forever, as he doesn't have infinite stamina. Piccolo states that before that happens, Android 17 will make a mistake.

Piccolo headbutts Android 17

At this point, Bulma has created a remote that will deactivate the Androids based on Dr. Gero's blueprints. Back at Kami's lookout, Gohan and Goku continue to wait outside of the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, growing impatient. They feel the massive energy of Cell approaching Piccolo and the Androids, worried that Piccolo won't be able to hold them off for much longer. Piccolo and Android 17 continue to fight on the deserted islands. They both give it their all and are evenly matched. Piccolo calls Android 17 an "early prototype" and Android 17 defiantly replies, "I am the ultimate Android! There are no improvements to be made!" (Apparently unaware of the existence of the mighty Cell) Before the fighting can resume, Piccolo looks in horror at a nearby rock, upon which Cell is standing. The Androids look in confusion to what is happening and Piccolo and Android 16 notice Imperfect Cell's new incredible power from absorbing many thousands of people.

Imperfect Cell's Arrival
PiccoloPwndImperfectCellEp151
Imperfect Cell soundly beats Piccolo

Immediately after Imperfect Cell interrupted the battle between Android 17 and Piccolo, he began to inspect the other Androids. He recognizes Android 17 as being "amazingly efficient" and Android 18 as "poetry in motion." Imperfect Cell stops short when he sees Android 16, brushing him off as an earlier, less efficient model. Android 17, however, does not recognize Imperfect Cell, and asks him to stop interrupting the battle. Meanwhile, Krillin flies off to meet Bulma to retrieve the remote control, and Tien watches the battle between Imperfect Cell, Piccolo, and the Androids from a nearby rock. Piccolo is shocked that the Androids do not even know who Imperfect Cell is, though intervenes to save them. The namek warns Android 17 and Android 18 that Imperfect Cell is another of Gero's creations and his purpose is to absorb them and be complete. Imperfect Cell takes this patiently and asks them to be merged with him to be the most powerful being that Dr. Gero dreamed of. Android 17 refuses the offer and stands willing to fight Imperfect Cell. Android 16 then warns 17 not to fight him because of his extreme power, advising Androids 17 and 18 to run away. However, they are still skeptical towards Imperfect Cell, and without realizing the seriousness of the threat he poses, they choose to stay. Imperfect Cell powers up to an unparalleled power, exploiting the thousands of lives he absorbed. He then beats Android 17 to a pulp in order to weaken him and absorb him by force. Piccolo tries to interfere but is easily overpowered. He launches his Light Grenade attack at Imperfect Cell, but he is not fazed by it. Imperfect Cell then breaks Piccolo's neck with a strong punch and launches an energy wave through Piccolo's stomach, tossing him into the sea. He does not immediately resurface and is presumed to be dead. Gohan, sensing that Piccolo's ki had disappeared, goes on a rage and has to be held down by Goku.

Android 16 fights Imperfect Cell

At this point, Android 16 finally decides to fight. He once again advises Android 18 to leave and tells her that he enjoyed the time they spent together. Coinciding with his tendency to peacefully observe nature, Android 16 expresses that the world is a good place, and he'd rather die than to live in fear. Android 16 then interrupts Imperfect Cell as he attempts to absorb Android 17 by punching him hard in the face and knocking him to the ground. Android 17 questions how Android 16 was able to do this, and 16 tells him that according to his calculations, his own power and strength is equal to that of Imperfect Cell. They begin to fight an even battle, with Android 16 having a slight upper hand. At one-point, Imperfect Cell strikes Android 16 in the neck with the point of his tail and attempts to absorb him, but his plan backfires, as 16 is a completely mechanical model with a different design than the other Androids. Then, Android 16 rips off Imperfect Cell's tail in order to put a stop to his absorbing capabilities, claiming that he is now "like a bee without a stinger." Unfortunately, Imperfect Cell is composed of the cells of Piccolo, therefore, he can regenerate his own body parts and limbs.

However, Android 16 refuses to give up and unleashes some of his secret techniques. 16 then throws him to the ground and launches a Hell's Flash directly at Imperfect Cell, which inflicts a huge amount of damage on Imperfect Cell but fails to kill him. Android 17, seeing Android 16's massive power, gets incredibly cocky and plans to finish off Imperfect Cell himself despite Android 16's repeated warnings to both Androids 17 and 18 to run away. Android 17 gets caught off guard and is finally absorbed by Imperfect Cell, who was hiding underground behind him. The other two Androids and Tien watch in horror as Android 17 is sucked into Imperfect Cell's body, as they are now all rendered powerless, and can do nothing to stop the monstrous Cell as begins his hideous transformation.

Semi-perfect cell
Semi-Perfect Cell after absorbing Android 17

Cell is now in his Semi-Perfect Form and his first act is to test out his power. He does this by attacking Android 16 with a blast that severely damages the android. By doing this, he gets a taste of what his power can do, and he has taken out the only thing preventing him from absorbing Android 18. After Android 18 refuses to join him, he tries to persuade her by using Android 17's voice, saying that he enjoys being a part of Semi-Perfect Cell. She doesn't fall for his trick and finally threatens to detonate herself destructing bomb, but Semi-Perfect Cell quickly informs her that while she's charging the blast, Semi-Perfect Cell will have enough time to stop and absorb her. Finally, Tien has had enough of just watching Semi-Perfect Cell torment others and decides to step in and try to stop Semi-Perfect Cell from absorbing 18. He manages to stall Semi-Perfect Cell with his new technique, the Neo Tri-Beam, while the Androids find a place to hide.

As Androids 16 and 18 make their escape to an island in the distance, Tien Shinhan is determined to hold off Semi-Perfect Cell for as long as he can by firing his Neo Tri-Beam. Tien fires several in a row, giving all the energy he has until he falls to the ground in a severely weakened condition. Though they were able to buy some precious time, the Neo Tri-Beams had little to no effect on the monstrous Semi-Perfect Cell. Angry that Android 18 was able to escape in the midst of the distraction, Semi-Perfect Cell turns his sights to killing Tien. Meanwhile, at The Lookout, Goku and Gohan sense what is going on below on Earth.

Piccolo recovering after a vicious attack from Imperfect Cell

Just as Semi-Perfect Cell is about to deliver the final blow to Tien, Goku appears using Instant Transmission. The sudden appearance of Goku catches Semi-Perfect Cell off guard, as they share words in their official meeting. The Saiyan promises to defeat Cell after getting stronger. Cell mocks Goku for his supposed cowardice but is surprised Goku is able to grab Tien and also Piccolo, who washed up to shore, barely clinging to life. Goku teleports back to Kami's Lookout just as Semi-Perfect Cell makes a move to attack him. Piccolo and Tien are then given a Senzu Bean whilst Semi-Perfect Cell searches for Android 18 in the neighboring islands.

The Saiyans Emerge
Just as Tien and Piccolo recover, they, along with Goku and Gohan, learn that Vegeta and Future Trunks have completed their training and are ready to emerge from the Hyperbolic Time Chamber. Meanwhile, Bulma and baby Trunks meet up with Krillin while flying in her aircraft. Bulma gives Krillin a remote control that is capable of shutting down Android 18 within a 10-meter range. She then flies up to Kami's Lookout.

Future Trunks after emerging from the Time Chamber

At the Lookout, Future Trunks and Vegeta emerge from the Hyperbolic Time Chamber after a year of intensive training (one day in real time). It is apparent that both of their powers have increased exponentially, and they have reached a whole new level of strength. There is also a physical change in Future Trunks' appearance; his face has matured slightly, he is now taller and more muscular than before, and his hair has grown to be shoulder-length. Bulma is surprised by the new length of Future Trunks' hair and questions why Vegeta's hair did not grow as well. Agitated, Vegeta informs her that a pure-blooded Saiyan's hair does not grow or change once he or she is fully grown.

Just before Vegeta and Future Trunks leave Kami's Lookout, Bulma provides everyone with new Saiyan Battle Armor that is identical to Vegeta's. All of them accept the armor, except for Piccolo, who is proud of his Namekian heritage, and Tien, who refuses to dress like Vegeta. Vegeta then rushes off to test his new power against Semi-Perfect Cell. Before Future Trunks leaves, Goku gives him two Senzu Beans, and Bulma, nervous about their well-being, requests that Future Trunks takes care of himself as well as Vegeta.

Goku tells Gohan he must become a Super Saiyan

After scarfing down a meal prepared by Mr. Popo, Goku and Gohan enter the Hyperbolic Time Chamber with a clear mission: to make Gohan a Super Saiyan and to ascend to a level even greater than that of a Super Saiyan. Gohan is surprised by the vast open space and gravity (10x the gravity of Earth) of the Hyperbolic Time Chamber. Goku instructs him to stay close at all times so that he does not get lost in the infinite space. Goku then tells him that he is a stricter teacher than Piccolo and that it is important for Gohan to become even stronger than Goku is. Gohan, though slightly overwhelmed and doubtful that he can obtain a power greater than his father's, is eager to begin training.

Super Vegeta

Vegeta powers up

Through a series of powerful energy blasts, Semi-Perfect Cell has depleted nearly every island in sight in his efforts to find Android 18. Only one island remains, the very island that Androids 16 and 18 are hiding upon, and Semi-Perfect Cell raises his hand to blow it up as well. However, Vegeta arrives just in time to stop him, with Future Trunks following closely behind. Semi-Perfect Cell, unaware of their intensive training in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, is unimpressed by the arrival of Vegeta and Future Trunks, believing that they will not present much of a challenge. Vegeta proudly proclaims that he is now the strongest warrior in the universe and exhibits his new strength by transforming into a Super Saiyan Second Grade. Semi-Perfect Cell is still not impressed, as he believes that he is superior to Vegeta no matter what transformation he goes through. He soon learns that he is no match for the Saiyan Prince.

VegetaSuperVsSemiPerfectCell
Super Vegeta delivers a heavy blow to Cell

The battle begins with the newly ascended Vegeta commanding complete control of the upper hand. Whatever attacks Semi-Perfect Cell throws at him, Vegeta counters them all, dominating in both strength and speed. As Future Trunks watches the battle, he recalls the struggles he faced in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber. While in the Chamber, Vegeta refused any help from Future Trunks, insisting that he only trains alone, which made his feelings of indifference towards his son even more apparent. However, in spite of Vegeta's lack of caring, Future Trunks still greatly yearns for his father's approval, expressing that, "I honored my father's wishes to be left alone, but I watched him from afar when I could, and I learned. I knew that my father would achieve the greatness he desired, he would climb any mountain that stood in his path, and I vowed that I would follow in his footsteps. I would make my own ascension so that one day I might face my father as his equal, and he will know that I am his son... Father, one day I will prove myself to you. Maybe then you'll understand that all of these dangers you're so eager to face...You don't have to face them alone."

Android 18 notices Krillin

While Vegeta battles Semi-Perfect Cell, Krillin arrives on the island with the remote control that Bulma gave him and soon locates the Androids. Even though he knows the importance of carrying out his mission to destroy Android 18, he hides behind a mountain, conflicted. Ever since Android 18 kissed Krillin on the mountainside road, he has developed strong feelings of affection for her and struggles internally against causing her any harm. Much to Android 18's surprise, Krillin smashes the remote. Back at the Lookout, Piccolo and Tien watch the fight. Piccolo mentions that Vegeta is toying with Semi-Perfect Cell, and he had the strength to defeat him a long time ago. He believes that decision may come back to haunt him. In the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, Gohan's chances of becoming Super Saiyan looks bleak. Goku then informs him that the transformation to Super Saiyan comes in response to a need, not a desire.

Future Trunks enters the battle

After dominating in battle, the ascended Vegeta has clearly proven himself superior to Semi-Perfect Cell. Vegeta then tells Cell that he has no chance of winning because even if by some miracle Cell managed to defeat him, Future Trunks would have finished him off. For the first time, Vegeta vocally acknowledges Trunks as his son, claiming that although Future Trunks is not as strong as Vegeta, it would be difficult to tell them apart because of Future Trunks' incredible fighting power. While listening to these words, Future Trunks has a pained look on his face, as if he is hiding something. At this point, Vegeta expresses his disappointment that Semi-Perfect Cell did not present enough of a challenge for Vegeta to test his new strength against. Semi-Perfect Cell, now more desperate than ever to absorb Android 18, conjures a plan to reach perfection. Because he is made up of the cells of Vegeta, he knows that Vegeta's greatest weakness is his pride. Semi-Perfect Cell then uses that weakness to manipulate Vegeta. Cell tells him that if he had the chance to reach his perfect form he would become a worthy adversary, and he claims that Vegeta would be no match for him. Vegeta, who hungers for a challenge and any chance to prove that he is the best, falls for Cell's trap. He steps back from battle, allowing Semi-Perfect Cell an open opportunity to absorb Android 18 so that he will become a worthy opponent.

Semi-Perfect Cell soon finds the Androids on the island, but Future Trunks blocks his path, stopping him before he can act. This angers Vegeta, who is eager to prove himself against Perfect Cell. Vegeta then steps in and attacks Future Trunks, hindering his efforts to stop Cell. Future Trunks, however, is determined to stop Cell from transforming at all costs, even if it means standing up to Vegeta. Vegeta laughs at Trunks, claiming that he does not have the guts to challenge his own father because he is weakened by his feelings. Future Trunks then proves him wrong, conjuring a powerful energy wave and blasting it at Vegeta.

Because of this, Vegeta realizes that Trunks is stronger-willed than he thought, and his determination earns Vegeta's respect. With Vegeta temporarily out of the way, Future Trunks, Krillin, and Android 16 work to keep Cell away from Android 18 in an all-out attack. However, Cell eventually uses Solar Flare, blinding everyone so that he can absorb Android 18 at long last. To prevent any interference, Semi-Perfect Cell creates a powerful barrier around himself as he transforms.

Meanwhile, in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, Gohan has realized that the only way for him to become a Super Saiyan is for his father to fight him at full power. Reluctant, Goku turns into a Super Saiyan and prepares to fire a Kamehameha at Gohan. He does so and Gohan is able to hold it off. While blocking it, Gohan expresses his determination to follow in his father's footsteps. He recalls the many times when he was in danger and his friends helped him, although he was not able to help them in return due to his lack of strength. This rage proves to be the incentive that Gohan needed, for he feeds off of his rage and transforms into a Super Saiyan, firing the blast back at Goku.

Back at the battlefield, an enraged Krillin attacks Perfect Cell along with Future Trunks, but the attack has no effect. Perfect Cell then knocks Krillin unconscious with a mere kick. Future Trunks gives him a Senzu Bean, and Krillin tells him that he has never felt such strength and power before. Krillin also tells Future Trunks that he can sense the massive power that Trunks is holding back, and he asks why he has not unleashed that power to put a stop to Cell. Future Trunks then recalls his training in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, stating that at one point, Vegeta reached a plateau, and Trunks was able to surpass him. However, Trunks does not want his father to know that he surpassed him because he fears that Vegeta would then hate him because of it. Even though Trunks has worked hard to gain his father's approval, he knows that Vegeta would rather lose than to accept someone's help because of his extreme pride. Therefore, Future Trunks refuses to step in and reveal his true power until the moment Vegeta loses consciousness. Perfect Cell then resumes his fight with an unimpressed Vegeta.

Super Vegeta preparing to unleash his Final Flash

At the start of the battle, Perfect Cell toys with Vegeta, allowing Vegeta to believe he actually has a chance to win, just as Vegeta did to Semi-Perfect Cell. Perfect Cell hides his true power and appears to have only gained speed by dodging all of Vegeta's attacks. Vegeta becomes frustrated, which affects his fighting for the worse, as he is too blinded by anger to fully concentrate. At one point, Vegeta charges at Cell and kicks him in the neck. This does not faze Cell at all, which utterly shocks Vegeta as he reveals that he put all of his energy into the kick. With only one kick, Cell sends Vegeta flying across the island, through several rock formations, and into the water. It takes a moment for Vegeta to resurface and stand back up. While he is down, Cell laughs at his apparent weakness, and thanks Vegeta for being a good warm-up, as well as allowing Cell to reach perfection, however foolish a mistake it was. Outraged, Vegeta flies into the sky and challenges Cell to take his next attack head-on. He concentrates nearly every ounce of energy he has left into a blast and launches it at Cell. Perfect Cell senses the massive energy Vegeta put into his Final Flash, attempting to dodge it at the last second but it destroys his right arm. However, he regenerates and then, with a short series of attacks, knocks Vegeta unconscious.

Trunks ascends in order to face Perfect Cell

After Perfect Cell deals his devastating blows to Vegeta, Future Trunks becomes enraged, and he transforms into a Super Saiyan Second Grade. He then instructs Krillin to take Vegeta away from the battlefield so that he can recover. Because he does not want his father to know that he has surpassed his power, Future Trunks allows Cell to take the upper hand as a distraction and does not fight back in defense until Vegeta is gone. Cell and Trunks then begin to fight on practically equal terms, as Cell has the advantage of speed, and Trunks has the advantage of strength. Perfect Cell then encourages Future Trunks to demonstrate more of his strength, leading Trunks to transform into a Super Saiyan Third Grade. As he gathers his energy, Piccolo observes him from above in amazement, stating that Trunks is now even stronger than Vegeta, and possibly Cell as well. Future Trunks, now thought to be the strongest warrior in the universe, attempts to attack Cell, but Cell easily dodges every blow. This confuses Trunks, as he believed his Super Saiyan Third Grade powers would be enough to defeat Cell. However, Perfect Cell eventually finds the flaw in Future Trunks' transformation, explaining that although the form grants him superior strength, it heavily incapacitates him in terms of speed. Cell knows that he is faster and taunts Trunks to charge up his strength, even more, knowing that it will only debilitate him further.

Goku tells Gohan the limitations of his new form

Back in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, Goku has discovered the Super Saiyan Second and Third Grades forms and immediately has discovered its weakness: the bulk of their muscles greatly affects their speed, and it would be useless to be so strong if you cannot catch your opponent. Goku then comes up with a plan to stay in Super Saiyan form for so long that it feels natural so they will not have to waste the energy of transforming and sustaining the transformation during battle. That way, they can increase their stamina with the energy they saved and balance their strength and speed while preserving their ki.

Cell announces tournament
Cell announces to Trunks the Cell Games to happen in 10 days

Future Trunks resumes his fight with Perfect Cell. Perfect Cell decides to exploit Future Trunks' weakness. He uses his speed advantage to defeat Future Trunks who is still wondering why he cannot touch Perfect Cell. Cell tells him why and explains that he could have increased his own strength if he wanted to. Realizing his foolish mistake, Trunks quits the battle and tells Perfect Cell that he can kill him. However, Perfect Cell lets him live and is curious about how Future Trunks and Vegeta gained so much power in so little time. This leads him to come up with an idea of having a tournament, the Cell Games, which will occur in ten days.

The saga begins with Cell's announcement of the Cell Games, which will be held 10 days after his television broadcast. Goku and Gohan emerge from the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, mastering Super Saiyan Full Power. Gohan's appearance comes as a surprise to the others, especially Piccolo and Chi-Chi, as he now has greater muscle mass and is taller than before (prior to entering the Chamber, Gohan reached Krillin's shoulders and/or just below Goku's chest in height. He now reaches Goku's shoulders). Using Instant Transmission, Goku visits Cell at the tournament platform in order to gain an understanding of his power. He then transmits himself back to the Lookout where the others are waiting. They ask Goku if he thinks he will be able to defeat Cell, and Goku calmly laughs it off, claiming that he does not really know and thinks Cell will probably beat him into the ground. This comes as a surprise to the others, as they do not understand why Goku is acting so aloof. Piccolo then reminds Goku that he and Gohan can go back into the Hyperbolic Time Chamber for one more day, but Goku refuses the offer. Once again, this comes as a surprise to the others. Goku tells them that he and Gohan will be training outside of the Chamber rather than subject their bodies to any more strain. This agitates Vegeta, who expresses his anger that Goku is always one step ahead of him, and he wonders exactly what secret Goku is hiding.

Goku channels his power for Korin

Goku and Gohan then pay a visit to Korin and ask if he can determine how Goku's power measures up against Cell. Korin deduces that Cell is stronger, and Goku once again laughs it off, claiming that he discovered a great secret while in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, which comes as a surprise to Gohan. For the next 9 days, most of the Dragon Team use their time to train, though Goku and Gohan train for only three days and spend the remaining six resting. Goku also pays a visit to New Namek and asks Dende to become the new Guardian of Earth. Eager to see Gohan again, Dende accepts the offer and creates a new Shenron, capable of granting three wishes, though this could be reduced to two if one wish took too much effort.

CellPerfectDefeatsMr
Perfect Cell effortlessly knocks away Mr. Satan into a mountain cliff

When the tournament commences, Goku decides he would be the first one to fight Perfect Cell. However, the World Champion Mr. Satan, along with his students in combat, Caroni and Pirozhki, attempt to fight Perfect Cell first, though each of them are easily flicked away and disqualified. First, Caroni attempts to attack Cell from high up, and Cell sent him even higher with his enormous energy. After falling, Caroni was convinced that Cell was tremendously powerful. Pirozhki attempts to rush at Cell head-first, only to be flicked backward by Cell's simple energy, which seemed too much for Pirozhki to handle. Mr. Satan then attempts to attack Cell with a slew of punches and kicks only to be knocked into the mountains. After this, throughout the entire tournament, Mr. Satan decides to claim he is suffering from intense stomach pains in order to avoid fighting Cell. He also calls the techniques in the ring "tricks" or "illusions". Goku and Perfect Cell begin to battle and in a heated display of power, technique and ability. To no one's surprise, Goku seems to be able to keep up against the mechanically engineered monster.

GokuVsCellNV
Goku battles Perfect Cell

Perfect Cell pulled out all kinds of tricks, performing various moves such as the Death Beam and Kamehameha. Goku and Perfect Cell battled for a while until Perfect Cell grew tired of being confined to the small ring. So Perfect Cell destroyed the ring and made the battle an all-out fight, just to make things more interesting for him, with no rules applied. Goku threw everything he could at Perfect Cell and even tricked Perfect Cell into believing he would destroy the Earth with a Kamehameha. Perfect Cell was noticeably afraid as Goku powered up the energy blast, but Goku tricked him by performing Instant Transmission to teleport directly in front of Perfect Cell and unleashed the blast on him.

Goku's Instant Kamehameha

The entire top half of Perfect Cell was disintegrated. The Z Warriors seemed content until the remains of Perfect Cell jumped to its feet and regenerated. Goku knew that if he continued the Earth would be destroyed, or Perfect Cell and himself would die fighting each other. Goku suddenly forfeited the match to Perfect Cell and surrendered. He reasoned that only one person could defeat Perfect Cell. When Goku revealed his son Gohan as his pick to fight, the Z Fighters were furious (noticeably Vegeta and Piccolo) and Perfect Cell was amused. Before Gohan and Cell begin to fight, Goku asked Krillin for a Senzu Bean, which he threw to Cell, surprising everyone. Goku explained to the Z Fighters that Cell was worn out from their fight, so it would not be fair. Krillin argues and even thought that Goku got a "screw loose or something". Cell gladly eats the Senzu Bean and proceeds with the fight.

Gohan vs. Perfect Cell
GohanGettingPunchedByCell
Cell punches Gohan

It took a while for the battle to commence between Gohan and Perfect Cell, and even longer for Gohan to get serious. As a Full Power Super Saiyan, he did no better than his father, and the Z Fighters were noticeably worried (except Goku). As the battle continued, Gohan told Perfect Cell to stop fighting, as the power he could harness when he becomes enraged would destroy everything. However, this only fueled Perfect Cell's desire to push Gohan to the limit, much to Gohan's horror. Finally, Android 16 decided to destroy Perfect Cell himself with the self-destruction device in his body. He wrapped his arms around Perfect Cell's torso with the purpose of killing them both. To Android 16's surprise, Krillin informs that the bomb had been removed by Bulma when she re-programmed him earlier during repairs. Perfect Cell then gained the upper hand and destroyed all of Android 16 but his head, which rolled over the battlefield. Perfect Cell even claimed that even if the bomb did blow up, he would most likely not be affected too much, despite his fearful look when he found out what Android 16 was intending to do.

CellJuniorsNV
The Cell Juniors attack

Perfect Cell then created 7 smaller blue versions of himself from his tail and christened them Cell Juniors. After they were born, he ordered them to attack the Z Fighters, but not kill them. Each Cell Jr. was close to the power of Perfect Cell himself. Only Vegeta and Future Trunks in their Super Saiyan Second Grade forms, and Piccolo, managed to hold them off for a while, but eventually all of them were brutally beaten up (even Goku, who was weakened from his fight with Perfect Cell).

Gohan transforms into a Super Saiyan 2 after witnessing Android 16's death

As Gohan watched these maniacal Cell Jr.'s heartlessly beat his friends and family, he became enraged, but it was still not enough. Perfect Cell, noticing Gohan's anger, ordered the Cell Juniors to kill everyone. At this point, Hercule discovered the head of Android 16 which, surprisingly, could still talk. Android 16 pleaded with Hercule to take him near Gohan (throw him if he had to), for the sake of the world. Hercule complied despite his fear and the Android's head landed between Gohan and Cell. Android 16 gave some advice and words of encouragement to Gohan, saying it was okay to fight sometimes to defend loved ones, and to protect the world he loved. Perfect Cell, overhearing this, claimed that this was good advice and promptly crushed Android 16's head beneath his foot. This was the boiling point when Gohan snapped. This enraged Gohan to his very limits and pushed him to a new level, Super Saiyan 2, the Super Saiyan level ascended beyond a Super Saiyan (although it was not named at this point in the series). Perfect Cell was pleased when Gohan reached this form, but Gohan's first action was mercilessly taking down the smaller Cell Juniors, which he defeated in a single hit each. The already astounded Z Warriors, with the exception of Goku, were amazed as Gohan and Perfect Cell began to battle, with Gohan dominating the powerful Android.

CellPerfectLosingNV
Cell pumps up when he loses his temper against Gohan

Even after Cell powered up to maximum (which surprised everyone, who all thought Cell was at full power when he fought Goku) and punched Gohan hard in the face, Gohan was barely fazed at all. With just two punches, Gohan almost incapacitated Cell completely. Perfect Cell truly learned fear when Gohan began dodging all of his attacks, taunting him, and overpowering even his strongest Kamehameha at point blank range. This almost destroyed Cell, but Gohan decided to let Cell suffer for a while, which made Goku order Gohan to kill Cell. But it was too late. Cell regenerated using Piccolo's Cells. Making the same mistake Future Trunks made earlier, he began a transformation that reduced his speed drastically, making him unable to hit Gohan. After Gohan had had enough of dodging Cell's punches, he kicked Cell in the face and then in the stomach. The kick to the stomach was hard enough to make Cell regurgitate Android 18, which made him revert to his Semi-Perfect form.

FutureTrunksKilledbyCell
Cell returns and immediately murders an unprepared Trunks

Enraged, Semi-Perfect Cell threatened to destroy the whole planet and began to self-destruct. Goku decided to step in because if he did not, Semi-Perfect Cell would have killed himself, destroying the planet with him. Goku used the Instant Transmission to reach Semi-Perfect Cell and then transmitted them both to King Kai's Planet, which was subsequently destroyed along with Goku, Semi-Perfect Cell, King Kai, Bubbles, and Gregory. The Z Warriors were in anguish over what had transpired and knew Goku took his life for the rest of the planet. But to their surprise, a strong wind began to blow, and a tremendously powerful force came upon them. Cell was back! A single Death Beam by Cell impaled Future Trunks and killed him. He came back in his "Perfect" Form due to the fact that his cells stored the memory of his perfect form, and he was exponentially stronger than before because his core remained unharmed, and from it he had regenerated. He had become a lot stronger thanks to the Saiyan cells inside him, which after a near-death experience, increased his power dramatically. This power increase brought Cell up to a form he calls "Ultimate Perfection".

Gohan saves Vegeta
Gohan injured after saving Vegeta

The previously distraught Gohan was in fact pleased to see Super Perfect Cell had returned and hoped to avenge his father. Vegeta, seeing his own son get killed by Super Perfect Cell, became stunned, but this soon turned into anger as he went into a berserk rage against Super Perfect Cell. Despite everyone telling him that Future Trunks could be revived by the Dragon Balls, Vegeta, who went Super Saiyan, attacked Super Perfect Cell mercilessly and attacked him with an array of energy blasts. It was absolutely hopeless, however, as Super Perfect Cell gave one hit to Vegeta that knocked him out and almost killed him. He was about to kill Vegeta off with a ki blast, but Gohan intercepted the blast with his own arm. It became badly damaged and hung limply at his side. Vegeta, in a rare moment, actually apologized to Gohan. Super Perfect Cell jumped back and prepared for an attack.

Super Perfect Cell Kamehameha
Super Perfect Cell prepares his Solar Kamehameha

Super Perfect Cell fired his Solar Kamehameha at Gohan which is stated by himself to have enough energy to destroy the entire solar system that they reside in. After losing use of one of his arms and seeing how much stronger Cell was now, Gohan seemingly lost all hope of destroying Super Perfect Cell and gave up, until he heard Goku communicating to him from the Other World via King Kai. Goku encouraged Gohan to believe in his power, and with new-found hope, Gohan prepared a one-handed Kamehameha. Since Gohan had used up a lot of energy and only used one arm, which had been injured by Super Perfect Cell's blast, for a Kamehameha, he was at a disadvantage. This coupled with the fact that Super Perfect Cell was equal to or greater than Gohan (when he first turned into a Super Saiyan 2) in power seemed to bring Gohan down all the more.

Walking Kamehameha
Gohan unleashes a final Kamehameha against Cell

The battle between the Kamehameha waves proved intense. As Tien, Piccolo, Vegeta, Krillin, and Yamcha watched, they begun to doubt Gohan's power. In a heated battle between Gohan and Super Perfect Cell, the Kamehameha wave grew and grew. Even though Cell nearly overtook Gohan several times, Gohan was aided by his father during the battle, who encouraged him and supported him against Super Perfect Cell. With this encouragement, Gohan was finally in the right state of mind to put forth his full power, which seemingly brought the Kamehameha duel to a standstill. Everyone but Vegeta also assisted him, in a four-sided attack. The distraction helped Gohan push his power even further. But it still was not enough. Vegeta, caught in his pride, ponders over whether to go help Gohan or stay on the sidelines. Finally, Vegeta's better side brought him to power up to maximum and go help Gohan.

Cell's Downfall

Super Perfect Cell is obliterated by Gohan's Kamehameha

Even though Gohan was giving it all of his power, Super Perfect Cell begins to take a huge upper hand in the struggle once again, which leaves everyone, even Goku and Gohan, very worried. Cell was about to fully overtake Gohan and the Earth and everything on it was about to be destroyed, when suddenly a surprise Galick Blazer from Vegeta leaves Super Perfect Cell a bit stunned and very distracted. Gohan seizes the opportunity, encouraged by Goku, and unleashes all the rest of his strength into the Kamehameha wave, which overwhelms Super Perfect Cell's Kamehameha and envelops him in the enormous energy. As Super Perfect Cell's body disintegrates it is obvious Super Perfect Cell cannot understand that he has been defeated. His core is the last thing to burn up in the Kamehameha, and its destruction marks the moment of Super Perfect Cell's death. Everyone was exhausted, especially Gohan, who had used up nearly all his energy to defeat Super Perfect Cell. Of course, despite his extreme fatigue and injuries, Gohan could only smile as the Z Fighters looked upon him with pride and as Goku told him how proud he was of him.

Despite his injuries and exhaustion, Gohan is able to smile after defeating Super Perfect Cell

After the battle ends, the heroes made their way to Kami's Lookout where Dende healed Gohan, and then Android 18 who Yamcha was scared of. After that, Gohan told everyone Krillin has a crush on Android 18. Super Perfect Cell was gone but so was Goku. The Z Warriors attempted to wish him back after wishing all of Cell's victims back (this included Future Trunks) but failed to revive Goku because he had already been wished back to life once before and Shenron cannot revive a person more than once. However, Goku decided to stay in Other World after explaining that he seems to attract evil people, so it would be better for the Earth to live in peace without him. He also said that Gohan surpassed him greatly now, so there would be no worries if another threat came. With the second wish, Krillin wanted the Androids to be wished into people due to his crush on Android 18. But Shenron could not grant the wish, as both Androids were stronger than him and he could not change anything about their persons. So, Krillin instead wished that the bombs inside both of them were removed. This Shenron could do with ease. Android 18, who had been hiding, revealed herself and got angry at Krillin for thinking that would soften her feeling for any of them, and partially out of Krillin mistaking Android 17 for her boyfriend instead of her twin brother. She then flew off, but not before saying "See you later."

MrSatanlies
Mr. Satan lies about defeating Cell

Piccolo planned to stay at Kami's Lookout to train Dende to become a good Guardian of Earth, and Gohan promised to visit him every once in a while. Future Trunks planned to stay for the night and leave for the future the next day after a good sleep. Tien told them he would probably never see them again, and after saying goodbye, left to see Chiaotzu. As everyone said their goodbyes and parted ways, Yamcha told Future Trunks what Vegeta did for him. After hearing this Future Trunks became, for the first time, proud of his father. Meanwhile, Hercule lies to the whole world by claiming credit for Super Perfect Cell's defeat. As Super Perfect Cell has been destroyed and Shenron has revived Cell's victims, the people of Earth believe that this is proof that Hercule defeated Super Perfect Cell and can magically revive the dead, despite seeing him lose foolishly to Perfect Cell on TV.

Future Trunks unleashes a final attack to destroy Imperfect Cell

After heartfelt goodbyes from the present (Gohan, Krillin, Yamcha, Bulma, her parents, and even Vegeta), Future Trunks returns to his own time via his time machine. Upon returning the future, he tells Future Bulma about everything that happened in the past and destroys both Android 17 and Android 18 with ease. Three years later, when Future Trunks was planning a trip to the present to tell them about the destruction of the Androids, Future Cell in his Imperfect Form would plan to kill him and take his time machine. However, he was quickly killed, due to Future Trunks' greatly increased power. His future is then restored to peaceful times as long as Future Trunks, the last Z Fighter, is alive. He then thanks Vegeta, Gohan and Goku for everything. Meanwhile, in the present time, Goku is enjoying the life with King Kai, Bubbles and Gregory. Goku wants to go to Grand Kai's Planet. King Kai agrees, and they begin to start walking on Snake Way.









When a green ogre named Shrek discovers his swamp has been 'swamped' with all sorts of fairytale creatures by the scheming Lord Farquaad, Shrek sets out with a very loud donkey by his side to 'persuade' Farquaad to give Shrek his swamp back. Instead, a deal is made. Farquaad, who wants to become the King, sends Shrek to rescue Princess Fiona, who is awaiting her true love in a tower guarded by a fire-breathing dragon. But once they head back with Fiona, it starts to become apparent that not only does Shrek, an ugly ogre, begin to fall in love with the lovely princess, but Fiona is also hiding a huge secret.

A Scottish man (voiced by Mike Myers) reads a fairy tale from a book:

"Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison but none prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss."

(laughing) A green hand rips the page out of the book. "Like that's ever gonna happen." Cut to an outhouse exterior. The toilet flushes. "What a load of..." The door slams open, revealing the man, a green ogre. He sees his house, built into the bottom of a large tree stump, and breathes a happy sigh. He lives a normal life (for an ogre). He undresses and takes a (mud) shower outside. He brushes his teeth (using a caterpillar's guts as toothpaste). He smiles into the mirror (but it cracks as in "The Munsters"). He jumps into a pond (and farts). Some dead fish float up, and he grabs one. After he gets dressed, he gets a giant slug out of a hollow log (for his dinner). Finally, he paints a "BEWARE. OGRE" sign and posts it.

Men burst out of a tavern in the town and plan to capture the ogre for a reward. They grab pitchforks and torches and head for his place. The ogre is eating a bowl of eyeballs. He burps to light his fireplace, swallows the fish, and then relaxes in his easy chair. The men finally arrive at the ogre's house at night. The ogre hears them, and sneaks up behind them. He frightens them by telling them what he could do to them, then he roars and they all flee in fear. The ogre sees a poster on the ground and picks it up: "WANTED. FAIRY TALE CREATURES. REWARD". He tosses it back on the ground and walks away.

In the forest, various fairy tale creatures are being loaded into wagons for the rewards: The Seven Dwarfs, a witch, an elf, Pinocchio, The Three Bears, Tinker Bell, etc. A talking donkey (voiced by Eddie Murphy) is next in line after Pinocchio (voiced by Cody Cameron). The Captain of the Guards (voiced by Jim Cummings) gives Gepetto (voiced by Chris Miller) five shillings for the "possessed toy". The donkey's owner (voiced by Kathleen Freeman) can't get him to talk when asked by the knights, so they drag her away. As she struggles with the knights, she kicks the lantern holding Tinker Bell, and it flies into the air, landing on the donkey and spilling pixie dust on him. He floats into the air. The donkey talks now as he floats away, saying, "You might have seen a house fly, maybe even a super fly, but I bet you aint never seen a donkey fly!" (copying the crows in "Dumbo"). Peter Pan (voiced by Michael Galasso) and the Three Little Pigs (voiced by Cody Cameron) are surprised that he can fly, but the Captain of the Guards is more surprised that he can talk. The pixie dust wears off, and the donkey falls to the ground. The knights try to seize him, but he runs into the forest.

The donkey bumps into the back of the ogre, who was posting a "KEEP OUT" poster on a tree. When the knights approach, the donkey hides behind the ogre. The Captain of the Guards announces that Lord Farquaad authorized him to arrest them and transport them to a designated resettlement facility. The ogre says, "Oh, really. You and what army?" The Captain looks back and sees that the other knights have run away, so he too runs away, yelling in fear. As the ogre walks away the donkey follows him and compliments him on how great he was with the guards. The donkey says that he doesn't have any friends and asks to stay with the ogre, who then tries to scare him away. The donkey just gives him a compliment on how scary that was and sings. The ogre tells the donkey that he is an ogre, but the donkey doesn't care. The donkey asks for the ogre's name, and he replies, "Shrek." Shrek lets the donkey stay at his house for one night (outside).

As Shrek eats his dinner, he hears a noise and shouts at the donkey to stay outside. He looks back at his table and sees the Three Blind Mice (voiced by Christopher Knights and Simon J. Smith). When he grabs the mice, The Seven Dwarfs push the case with Snow White onto the table. They tell Shrek it's because the bed's taken, and Shrek sees that The Big Bad Wolf is in it. He grabs the wolf and tosses him out, but sees hundreds of fairy tale creatures camped outside his house. Pinocchio and one of the pigs tell Shrek that Lord Farquaad evicted them and put them there. The donkey tells Shrek that he knows where Lord Farquaad is, so Shrek announces that their welcome is worn out, that he will see Farquaad right now so that he can get them all off his swamp and back where they all came from. They all cheer. Shrek tells the donkey that he is coming with him. The donkey is happy and says, "Shrek and Donkey, on a whirlwind big city adventure." Donkey then starts singing "On The Road Again", but Shrek makes him hum it instead.

In a castle, the town's lord walks down a hallway. When he reaches the guards at the end, it's obvious that he is a dwarf. He enters the torture chamber where the executioner, Thelonius (voiced by Christopher Knights), is drowning The Gingerbread Man (voiced by Conrad Vernon) in a glass of milk. The lord (voiced by John Lithgow) torments The Gingerbread Man, and then crumbles one of his severed legs. He tells The Gingerbread Man that he and all the other fairy tale trash are monsters that are poisoning his perfect world. He demands that The Gingerbread Man tell him where the others are and starts to tear off one of his gumdrop buttons. The Gingerbread Man then rambles on about The Muffin Man, but they are interrupted by knights who bring in The Evil Queen's Magic Mirror. The lord knocks The Gingerbread Man into a trash can then asks, "Mirror mirror on the wall, is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all?" The Magic Mirror (voiced by Chris Miller) replies that he is not technically a king yet, but can become one by marrying a princess. The Magic Mirror then presents the eligible bachelorettes, "Dating Game" style: Cinderella, Snow White, and Princess Fiona (in the castle guarded by a dragon). Upon prompting by Thelonius, Lord Farquaad picks Princess Fiona. The Magic Mirror then displays Princess Fiona while playing "Escape (The Piña Colada Song)". Lord Farquaad says that she's perfect, and that finally he will be the perfect king. The Magic Mirror tries to tell him what happens at night after sunset, but he tells the mirror to be quiet. Lord Farquaad then announces that they are going to have a tournament.

Shrek and Donkey reach the castle at Duloc. The parking lot is arranged like the one at Disneyland. Shrek remarks that it must be Lord Farquaad's castle. It's extremely tall, and Shrek jokes that he could be compensating for something. As they approach the roped lines for the ticket booth, Shrek tries to talk to Duloc's costumed mascot (voiced by Andrew Adamson), which looks like Lord Farquaad, but he runs away in fear through the lines. Shrek walks straight through the ropes, dragging them along as Donkey follows, and tries to calm the mascot down. The mascot gets knocked out when he runs into the turnstile. Shrek and Donkey go through the turnstile. Elevator music plays in the otherwise quiet and deserted courtyard. The souvenir shop only has Lord Farquaad items. Donkey sees an information booth and pulls the lever. There is some clicking, and then the doors open, revealing music and wooden puppets (like in "It's a Small World") that sing the rules for Duloc, "a perfect place". The doors shut and a camera takes Shrek and Donkey's picture, then their photo comes out, showing them stunned.

Shrek and Donkey hear fanfare and go in that direction. Lord Farquaad is high upon a balcony announcing that the tournament winner (champion) will have the privilege to go rescue Princess Fiona. Shrek and Donkey march past the contestants (knights), then Farquaad instead tells the knights that the one who kills the ogre will be named champion. Shrek bursts open a wine barrel to slip up some knights, then slides through the brew, swinging at them with one of their axes like a hockey player. Donkey climbs onto the other barrel and rolls over some more knights. When more knights arrive, Shrek jumps into a corral and fights them like a professional wrestler. After a while, the crowd cheers for Shrek. Donkey joins in, "tag team" style, knocking out another knight. After Shrek sits on another knight, a woman (voiced by Jacquie Barnbrook) shouts for Shrek to give "give him the chair", so he whacks him over the head with a chair. After Shrek throws the last knight, Donkey kicks him, knocking him out. Shrek hams it up for the crowd. Lord Farquaad signals to the knights with crossbows, but instead of giving the order to kill Shrek, he proclaims that Shrek is the champion. Farquaad tells Shrek that he won the honor to go on the quest. Shrek replies that he is already on a quest to get his swamp back, where Farquaad dumped the fairy tale creatures. Farquaad offers a deal to Shrek that if he goes on this quest, Farquaad will give him his swamp back, with the squatters gone, so Shrek agrees.

On the way to rescue Princess Fiona, Shrek and Donkey pass through various vegetable fields. As Shrek munches on some vegetables, Donkey asks Shrek why he's going to fight a dragon and rescue a princess to get his swamp back, which Farquaad filled with "freaks". He tells Shrek that he should act like an ogre, and lay siege to his fortress and grind his bones. Shrek sarcastically suggests that instead he could have decapitated some villagers and drank their fluids. Shrek tells Donkey that there's a lot more to ogres than people think, that they are like onions and have layers.

Shrek and Donkey pass a run-down windmill. After two days, they finally reach the castle where Princess Fiona is held, up on a mountain. Dried lava and brimstone are everywhere. Donkey thinks the smell is from Shrek, but Shrek tells Donkey that if it were him, Donkey would be dead. They reach a footbridge over a river of lava leading to the castle. Donkey is afraid to cross, but Shrek backs him up, tricking him to cross.

Inside the castle, Shrek tells Donkey to look for stairs so they can reach Princess Fiona. Shrek puts on some armor of a dead knight. Suddenly, the dragon breathes fire and chases after Donkey. Shrek grabs the dragon's tail, but it shakes him off, sending him flying into Princess Fiona's room and waking her up. Meanwhile, the dragon has Donkey trapped. Donkey complements it on its white teeth, notices that it's a girl dragon, and gives it more appropriate compliments. The dragon picks him up with her teeth and walks happily away. While Shrek recovers, Princess Fiona lies back down on the bed and pretends to sleep. Shrek approaches her but instead of kissing her, he shakes her forcefully and shouts for her to wake up. Princess Fiona (voiced by Cameron Diaz) wants romance, but Shrek keeps his helmet on and drags her down the stairs. Down below, the dragon is cuddling and romancing Donkey. Shrek grabs a hanging chain and swings towards the dragon, but the chain is stuck up above. He shakes it loose, and he falls, knocking Donkey away as the dragon is about to kiss him. The dragon kisses Shrek's naked butt. The chain's frame falls around the dragon's neck like a collar. Shrek and Donkey run away, then Shrek grabs Donkey and Fiona as the dragon chases them, repeatedly breathing fire. They crisscross the castle and the chain tangles around all the pillars. Shrek locks the chain into the floor with a sword. As they run across the bridge the dragon burns half of it up, but they make it safely across. The dragon tries to fly after them, but the chain holds it back.

Safely on the other side, Fiona demands that Shrek remove his helmet and kiss her. He removes his helmet, and she is shocked and disappointed that he is an ogre. Shrek tells her that Lord Farquaad sent him, that he's the one who wants to marry her. Princess Fiona tells him in that case that Lord Farquaad should rescue her and she refuses to leave. Shrek picks her up then they head back to Duloc. When Shrek finally sets Fiona down she asks Shrek and Donkey what Duloc and Lord Farquaad are like. Shrek and Donkey start making short jokes about him. She says that they are just jealous of him. When she hears that they will get to Duloc the next day, Fiona gets upset and insists that they make camp immediately. They find a rock cliff, and Princess Fiona sleeps alone in a small enclosure on it. Shrek tells Donkey stories about the stars, and then says that things are more than they appear. Donkey wonders what they will do when they get back to their swamp, but Shrek tells him that it's his swamp, and he is going to build a ten-foot wall around his land. Donkey thinks that Shrek is trying to keep people out, then Shrek shouts at Donkey that he's trying to keep everyone out. Fiona wakes up and slides the door open, then overhears Shrek telling Donkey how people judge him before they even know him, and that's why he's better off alone. Fiona closes the door then Donkey and Shrek talk about the stars again.

At his castle, Lord Farquaad is in bed with a drink and repeatedly makes the Magic Mirror show him the picture of Princess Fiona. He says that she's perfect.

The next morning, Princess Fiona sings with a bird, but it explodes when she hits a high note. She cooks the bird's eggs for breakfast. Fiona tells Shrek and Donkey that she is making it up to them because they got off to a bad start yesterday; after all, they rescued her. As they walk towards Duloc, Shrek burps then Fiona burps too. Suddenly a man (voiced by Vincent Cassel) swinging from a vine grabs Fiona. He calls out for his Merry Men. They all appear, dancing and singing about him, Robin Hood. As he brandishes a knife, Robin Hood finishes the song by saying he will cut out Shrek's heart, but Fiona swings down and knocks him into a boulder. She defeats the Merry Men with Kung Fu mixed with "The Matrix". Shrek and Donkey are amazed. Shrek asks Fiona where she learned that, and she replies that when one lives alone one has to learn these things. She sees that there's an arrow in Shrek's butt. Donkey starts panicking, so Fiona sends him off looking for a blue flower with red thorns. When Fiona tries to pull out the arrow from Shrek's butt, he squirms, falls to the ground, and Fiona lands on him -- just as Donkey returns with the flower. Donkey gets mad because he thinks they just wanted to be alone. When Fiona pulls out the arrow, Donkey sees the blood and faints. Shrek picks him up, and they head back to Duloc.

In a field, Princess Fiona grabs a spider's web and gathers up the flying bugs bothering Shrek, giving it to him, who eats it like cotton candy. Shrek catches a frog and inflates it like a balloon, handing it to Fiona. Fiona grabs a snake off a tree branch and inflates it like a balloon, and gives it to Shrek. They push each other playfully, then run off together, and their balloons float away into the air.

They finally reach the windmill and see Duloc in the distance. Shrek shrugs and tells Princess Fiona that her future awaits her, and she's surprised to see Duloc. Donkey interrupts, and tells Fiona that Shrek thinks Lord Farquaad is compensating for something. Donkey starts to say that it means Farquaad "has a really..." Shrek knocks him down, a little too hard, and then tells Fiona that they should move on and starts walking. Fiona tells Shrek that she's worried about Donkey, that he doesn't look so good. Shrek comes over and plays along with her pretense, and says that he looks awful. Fiona tells Donkey that she'll make him some tea. Donkey then acts like a hypochondriac. Shrek and Fiona go to find dinner and firewood. Fiona likes the food Shrek cooked (weed rat), saying that it's delicious. She sighs, then looks at Duloc and says that she'll be eating differently tomorrow night. He hopes that she will visit him in the swamp, because he'll cook for her. She says that she would like that, and then they smile and look at each other. Shrek begins to ask Fiona something important, but changes his mind and asks for the rest of her food. They lean towards each other, about to kiss. Donkey butts in, saying that the sunset is romantic. Fiona jumps up, panicking. She pretends to be afraid of the dark, and Donkey tells her that he is afraid of the dark too. Fiona goes into the windmill to sleep by herself, glancing back briefly at Shrek. Donkey tells Shrek that he can tell with his animal instincts that Shrek and Fiona "were digging on each other," and says that Shrek should tell Fiona how he feels about her. Shrek tries to deny that he likes her, and then dejectedly says that Fiona is a princess and he is an ogre. He walks off and tells Donkey that he's getting more firewood, but Donkey sees that there's still a large pile of firewood there. Shrek sits alone by a field of sunflowers, staring at Duloc until night.

Donkey, afraid to be alone by himself in the dark, goes inside the windmill looking for Princess Fiona. A large green hand grabs the ladder, and then a female ogre looks down on Donkey as he wanders around. All the sights and sounds frighten Donkey. The ogre falls through the wood and screams as she lands on the floor, frightening Donkey even more. He's terrified when she stands up, and he screams for Shrek. Donkey asks her what she did with the princess. She tries to calm and quiet him down, saying that it's her, in this body. He thinks that she ate the princess and shouts at her stomach, then calls for Shrek again. She finally calms him down and convinces him that she is the princess. He wonders what happened to her, telling her that she's... different. She admits that she's ugly. Donkey thinks it's because she ate the weed rat, but she tells him that she's been this way as long as she can remember. She says that it only happens when the sun goes down. She looks at her reflection in a barrel of water and recites a spell: "By night one way, by day another. This shall be the norm until you find love's first kiss and then take love's true form." She tells Donkey that when she was a little girl a witch cast a spell on her; every night she becomes "this, this horrible, ugly beast"; she was placed in a tower to await the day her true love would rescue her. Fiona sits down and tells Donkey that it's why she has to marry Farquaad tomorrow before the suns sets and he sees her like this. She cries, and then Donkey tries to console her. He says that she's ugly, but adds that she only looks like this at night, and that Shrek is ugly all the time. She replies that she's a princess, and it's not how a princess should look. Donkey suggests that she shouldn't marry Farquaad. She insists that she has to, because only her true love's first kiss can break the spell. Donkey tells her that she's an ogre, and Shrek's an ogre, and that they have a lot in common.

Shrek walks back to the windmill, holding a sunflower. He's rehearsing what he will say to Princess Fiona when he gives it to her. When he climbs the steps of the windmill, he overhears Fiona telling Donkey that she just can't marry whomever she wants, and to take a good look at her. She asks Donkey, "Who could ever love a beast so hideous and ugly? Princess and ugly don't go together. That's why I can't stay here with Shrek. My only chance to live happily ever after is to marry my true love." She tells Donkey that it's just how it should be. Shrek becomes disheartened because he thinks Fiona was calling him ugly, and then throws the sunflower down and storms off towards Duloc. Fiona tells Donkey that it's the only way to break the spell. He tells her that she has to tell Shrek the truth and starts to leave, but she says that no one must ever know and makes Donkey promise not to tell anyone. Donkey says that she should tell Shrek, then goes outside. Fiona opens the door and looks around, but only sees the sunflower and takes it inside. Donkey looks around then sleeps by the campfire.

In the morning, Princess Fiona picks off the petals of the sunflower, reciting the "He loves me, he loves me not" game, but instead saying, "I tell him, I tell him not." She pulls off the last petal, excited that she should tell Shrek about her spell. She opens the door and calls for him, but only sees Donkey outside snoring. The sun rises and she transforms back to human form. Shrek walks up and she rushes to greet him, but he angrily walks past her and sits on the steps. She says that she has to tell him something, but he replies that he heard everything she said last night. She says that she thought he would understand. He says he understands, quoting her asking, "Who could ever love a hideous, ugly beast?" She says that she thought it wouldn't matter to him, but he says that it does. A horse whinnies and they turn around. Fanfare announces Lord Farquaad's arrival as he rides towards them, accompanied by some knights, then Donkey wakes up. Farquaad greets Princess Fiona, and then Shrek demands that Farquaad give him the deed to his swamp, as promised. Farquaad tells Shrek that the swamp is cleared out as agreed, then tells him to take the deed and go before he changes his mind. Shrek grabs the deed and stands aside. Farquaad calls Fiona beautiful. She tells him that she was just saying a short farewell, just as a knight sets him on the ground. Farquaad says that it's sweet, that she doesn't have to waste good manners on the ogre; it doesn't have feelings. Fiona agrees that "it" doesn't. Farquaad grabs her hand and proposes to her. She looks at Shrek, who is staring at his deed, then accepts. Farquaad jumps up happily and tells her that he'll make plans for them to marry tomorrow. She stops him and says that they should get married today, before the sun sets. Shrek angrily walks back to his swamp. Farquaad agrees that they should get married today, and talks about all the things to prepare. They both get on the horse and head to Duloc, and then Fiona tells Shrek "fare-thee-well." Donkey tries to stop Shrek and says that there's something he doesn't know about Fiona. Shrek shouts at Donkey that he heard what they said last. He tells Donkey that since he and Fiona are great friends, Donkey should follow her home. Donkey replies that he wants to go with Shrek. Shrek continues shouting at Donkey that he lives alone in his swamp, not with anyone else, "especially useless, pathetic, annoying, talking donkeys!" Shrek storms off to his swamp.

("Hallelujah" by John Cale plays in the background.) At his swamp, Shrek sees that the fairy tale creatures are gone; only their tents remain, along with some debris. He sighs heavily and walks back to his house. Donkey walks through the forest, sadly glancing back. Shrek sees his reflection in a puddle of water, and then sadly lowers his head. Princess Fiona, in her wedding gown, looks sadly out the window. Shrek looks sadly out his window, then angrily takes a sunflower off the table and throws it into the fireplace. Fiona sadly looks at herself again in the mirror. Farquaad looks at himself in the Magic Mirror, which smiles only when he's looking at it. Fiona looks at the wedding cake and pushes the figurine of Farquaad down to its proper height. She turns around and quizzically looks at the suit of armor. At the same spot, in his house, Shrek leans sadly against the table and stares at the fireplace. Donkey drinks from a pond by the forest, then is startled when he hears and sees the dragon crying; they console each other. Shrek is alone, and tries to eat at his table; Fiona is alone, and tries to eat at her table; they both put their faces in their hands.

Shrek hears a thumping sound outside and opens the door to see Donkey putting branches on the ground. Donkey tells him that it's a wall. Shrek tells him that a wall should go around his swamp. Donkey replies that it does go around his half of the swamp, and that Donkey gets the other half. Donkey tells Shrek that he earned half of the swamp because he did half of the work rescuing the princess. They argue over ownership of the swamp. Shrek gives up and walks away, saying that he's done with Donkey, then Donkey chases after him. Donkey says that Shrek just thinks about himself; he's mean to Donkey, insults him, doesn't appreciate him, and pushes him around or away. Shrek asks Donkey that if he treated him so bad, why did he come back? Donkey replies that it's what friends do: they forgive each other. Shrek agrees, and then he shouts that he forgives Donkey for stabbing him in the back. Shrek goes into the outhouse and slams the door. Donkey tells Shrek that he's so wrapped up like onion layers in his feelings. Shrek tells Donkey to go away, but he tells Shrek that he's "doing it again," like he did to Fiona; all she ever did was love him. Shrek replies that he heard their conversation, that she called him ugly, a hideous creature. Donkey tells him that she wasn't talking about him, but was talking about somebody else. Shrek comes out and asks who she was talking about. Donkey refuses to tell him because Shrek doesn't listen to him. Shrek apologizes, and admits that he is just a big, stupid, ugly ogre. Donkey forgives him because that's what friends are for. Shrek wonders what Fiona said about him, but Donkey tells him to ask her. Shrek cries out that they won't make the wedding in time. Donkey whistles and the dragon flies down. Shrek climbs the chain up then the dragon puts Donkey up too. They fly away to Duloc.

At the castle, the bishop (voiced by Val Bettin) is marrying Princess Fiona and Lord Farquaad. Thelonius holds the rings. Two men hold up cue cards for the audience's appropriate response. Fiona interrupts and asks the bishop to skip to the "I do's". Farquaad chuckles and tells the bishop to continue. The dragon lands outside, and then the knights run away fearfully. Shrek goes to the door of the church, but Donkey tells him to wait until the preacher says, "Speak now or forever hold your peace", then for Shrek to say, "I object!" Shrek says that he doesn't have time for this, but Donkey replies that chicks like romance. They go to the side of the church and Shrek repeatedly throws Donkey up to look through a window. Donkey tells Shrek that they are already married. Shrek bursts into the church just before Farquaad and Fiona kiss, shouting that he objects. Fiona and Farquaad are annoyed to see him. Shrek wants to talk to Fiona, but she says that it's too late and tries to kiss Farquaad. Shrek grabs her hand and tells her that Farquaad only wants to marry her so that he can be king, then tells her that Farquaad is not her true love. Fiona asks him what he knows about true love. Shrek stammers, and Farquaad laughs because Shrek loves the princess. Farquaad cues the laughter. Fiona asks Shrek if it's true, but Farquaad grabs her hand and insists that she kiss him now. Fiona looks at the setting sun and recalls her spell. She walks to the window and tells Shrek that she wanted to show this to him before. She transforms into an ogre, and then grins sheepishly at Shrek. As for Shrek, he can only casually note that her state explains a lot about her recent behaviour.

The audience is shocked. Farquaad sees Fiona and says that "it" is disgusting and orders his guards to get "it" out of his sight, to get them both. As Shrek and Fiona try to reach each other, Farquaad declares that the marriage is still binding, that he is still king, and puts on the crown. As guards drag Shrek away, Farquaad tells that he'll beg for death. He then tells Fiona that he'll lock her back in that tower for the rest of her life. Shrek frees one of his hands and whistles. The dragon bursts through the large stained glass window with Donkey on top and swallows Farquaad, killing him, then burps out his crown. Shrek tells Fiona that he loves her, and she tells him that he loves him too. They kiss, and then Fiona begins her transformation as her voice-over recounts the rest of the spell. She rises up into the air, glowing. Bright light radiates from her, then a shock wave from her shatters all the windows in the church except one (which the dragon later breaks). Fiona completes her transformation, and then returns to the floor and collapses. Shrek helps Fiona up. She's still an ogre, and tells Shrek that she doesn't understand, that she's supposed to be beautiful. Shrek tells her that she is beautiful, and they kiss again.

At the swamp, Shrek and Fiona get married, with Donkey and all the fairy tale creatures as guests. The wedding song is "I'm a Believer", by Smash Mouth. One of the fairy godmothers transforms the three blind mice into horses, and a garlic bulb into a carriage, and then Shrek and Fiona leave in the carriage. Donkey takes over the song, with the others singing and dancing. The wedding celebration continues while Shrek and Fiona ride away into the sunset.

The fairy tale ends with "And they lived ugly ever after. The end." The book closes, revealing the fairy tale to be "Shrek", and the song ends.

Shrek Script

 {Man} Once upon a time there was a lovely princess.

But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only 

be broken by love's first kiss.

She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing 

dragon.

Many brave knigts had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, 

but non prevailed.

She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest 

tower for her true love and true love's first kiss.

{Laughing} 

Like that's ever gonna happen.

{Paper Rusting, Toilet Flushes}

What a load of - 



Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me

I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed

She was lookin' kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb

In the shape of an "L" on her forehead

The years start comin' and they don't stop comin'

Fed to the rules and hit the ground runnin'

Didn't make sense not to live for fun

Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb

So much to do so much to see

So what's wrong with takin' the backstreets

You'll never know if you don't go

You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey, now You're an all-star

Get your game on, go play

Hey, now You're a rock star

Get the show on, get paid

And all that glitters is gold

Only shootin' stars break the mold

It's a cool place and they say it gets colder

You're bundled up now but wait till you get older

But the meteor men beg to differ

Judging by the hole in the satellite picture

The ice we skate is gettin' pretty thin

The water's getting warm so you might as well swim

My world's on fire

How 'bout yours

That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored

Hey, now, you're an all-star

{Shouting}

Get your game on, go play

Hey, now You're a rock star

Get the show on, get paid

And all that glitters is gold

Only shootin' stars break the mold

{Belches}

Go!

Go!

{Record Scratching}

Go. Go.Go.

Hey, now, you're an all-star

Get your game on, go play

Hey, now You're a rock star

Get the show on, get paid

And all that glitters is gold

Only shootin' stars break the mold



-Think it's in there?

-All right. Let's get it!

-Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you?

-Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.

{Laughs}

-Yes, well, actually, that would be a gaint.

Now, ogres - - They're much worse.

They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin.

-No!

-They'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes!

Actually, it's quite good on toast.

-Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya!

{Gasping}

-Right.

{Roaring}

{Shouting}

{Roaring}

{Whispers} This is the part where you run away.

{Gasping}

{Laughs}

{Laughing} And stay out!

"Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."

{Sighs}

{Man's voice} All right. This one's full.

-Take it away!

{Gasps}

-Move it along. Come on! Get up!

-Next!

-Give me that! Your fiying days are over.

That's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next!

-Get up! Come on!

-Twenty pieces.

{Thudding}

-Sit down there!

-Keep quiet!

{Crying}

-This cage is too small.

-Please, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again.

I can change. Please! Give me another chance!

-Oh, shut up.

-Oh!

-Next!

-What have you got?

-This little wooden puppet.

-I'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy.

-Five shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away.

-Father, please! Don't let them do this!

-Help me!

-Next! What have you got?

-Well, I've got a talking donkey.

{Grunts}

-Right. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it.

-Oh, go ahead, little fella.

-Well?

-Oh, oh, he's just - - He's just a little nervous.

He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt - -

-That's it. I've heard enough. Guards!

-No, no, he talks! He does. I can talk. I love to talk.

I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw.

-Get her out of my sight.

-No, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk!

{Gasps}

-Hey! I can fly!

-He can fly!

-He can fly!

-He can talk!

-Ha, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey.

You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly

but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha!

Oh-oh.

{Grunts}

-Seize him!

-After him! He's getting away!

{Grunts, Gasps}

{Man}

-Get him! This way! Turn!

-You there. Orge!

-Aye?

-By the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under 

arrest

and transport you to a designated..... resettlement facility.

-Oh, really? You and what army?

{Gasps, Whimpering}

{Chuckles}

-Can I say something to you?

-Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. 

Incredible!

Are you talkin' to - - me? Whoa!

-Yes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great 

back here? Those guards!

They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They 

was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made 

me feel good to see that.

-Oh, that's great. Really.

-Man, it's good to be free.

-Now, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? 

Hmm?

-But, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by 

myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. 

You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit 

out of anybody that crosses us.

{Roaring}

-Oh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that 

don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you 

definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks!

You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time - - 

{Mumbling}

Than I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases eking out of my 

butt that day.

-Why are you following me?

-I'll tell you why. 



'Cause I'm all alone

There's no one here beside me

My promlems have all gone

There's no one to deride me

But you gotta heve friends - - 



-Stop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends.

-Wow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest.

-Listen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I?

-Uh - - Really tall?

-No! I'm an orge! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't 

that bother you?

-Nope.

-Really?

-Really, really.

-Oh.

-Man, I like you. What's you name?

-Uh, Shrek.

-Shrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek?

You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing.

I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. Whoo! Look at that. 

Who'd want to live in place like that?

-That would be my home.

-Oh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a 

decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I 

like that boulder. That is a nice boulder.

-I guess you don't entertain much, do you?

-I like my privacy.

-You know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I 

hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them 

a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence.

-Can I stay with you?

-Uh, what?

-Can I stay with you, please?

-Of course!

-Really?

-No.

-Please! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to 

be considered a freak. Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta 

stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please!

-Okay! Okay! But one night only.

-Ah! Thank you!

-What are you - - No! No!

-This is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, 

and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles.

-Oh!

-Where do, uh, I sleep?

-Outside!

-Oh, well. I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you 

don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know.

{Sniffles}

-Here I go.

-Good night.

{Sighs}

-I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. 

I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, 

outside.



I'm all alone

There's no one here beside me

{Bubbling}

{Sighs}

{Creaking}

{Sighs}

-I thought I told you to stay outside.

-I'm outside.

{Clattering}

-Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we 

have? 

-It's not home, but it'll do just fune.

-What a lovely bed.

-Got ya.

{Sniffs} I found some cheese.

-Ow! {Grunts}

-Blah! Awful stuff.

-Is that you, Gorder?

-How did you know?

-Enough! What are you doing in my house?

{Grunts}

-Hey!

{Snickers}

-Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table.

-Where are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken.

-Huh?

{Gusps}

{Male voice} What?

-I live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying orge! What do I 

have to do get a little privacy?

-Aah!

-Oh, no. No! No!

{Cackling}

-What?

-Quit it.

-Don't push.

{Squeaking}

{Lows}

- What are you doing in my swamp?

{Echoing}

Swamp! Swamp! Swamp!

{Gasping}

-Oh, dear!

-Whoa!

-All right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! 

Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey!

-Quickly. Come on!

-No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there.

-Oh!

{Sighs}

-Hey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them.

-Oh, gosh, no one invited us.

-What?

-We were forced to come here.

-By who?

-Lord Farquaad.

-He huffed und he puffed und he...... signed an eviction notice.

{Sighs}

-All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?

{Murmuring}

-Oh, I do. I know where he is.

-Does anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all?

-Me! Me!

-Anyone?

-Oh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me!

{Sighs}

-Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. 

Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy 

Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came 

from!

{Cheering}

{Twittering}

-Oh! You! You're comin' with me.

- All right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two 

stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it!

-On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek.

-Hey. Oh, oh!

-I can't wait to get on the road again.

-What did I say about singing?

-Can I whistle?

-No.

-Can I hum it?

-All right, hum it.

{Humming}



{Grunts}

{Whimpering}

-That's enough. He's ready to talk.

{Coughing}

{Laughing}

{Clears throat}

-Run, run, run, as fust as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the 

gingerbread man!

-You are a monster.

-I'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy 

tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the 

others?

-Eat me!{Grunts}

-I've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached 

its end! Tell me or I'll - -

-No, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons.

-All right then. Who's hiding them?

-Okay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man?

-The muffin man?

-The muffin man.

-Yes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane?

-Well, she's married to the muffin man.

-The muffin man?

-The muffin man!

-She's married to the muffin man.

{Door opens}

-My lord! We found it.

-Then what are you waiting for? Bring it in.

{Man grunting}

{Gasping}

-Oh!

-Magic mirror - - 

-Don't tell him anything!

-No!

{Ginerbread man whispers}

-Evening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect 

kingdom of them all?

-Well, technically you're not a king.

-Uh, Thelonius.

-You were saying?

-What I mean is, you're not a king yet. But you can become one.  All 

you have to do is marry a princess.

-Go on.

{Chuckles}

-So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to 

meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette 

number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. 

She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking 

and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella.

-Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of 

fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just 

kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come 

on. Give it up for Snow White!

-And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a 

fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling 

lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes 

pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, 

Princess Fiona!

-So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or 

bachelorette number three?

-Two! Two!

-Three! Three!

-Two! Two!

-Three! 

-Three? One?

{Shudders} Three?

--Three! Pick number three, my lord!

-Okay, okay, uh, number three!

-Lord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona.



If you like pina coladas

And getting caught in the rain



-Princess Fiona.



If you're not into yoga



-She's perfect. All I have to do is just find someone who can go - - 

-But I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night.

-I'll do it.

-Yes, but after sunset - -

-Silence! I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will 

finally have the perfect king!

Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament.



-But that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd 

find it.

-So, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle.

-Uh-huh. That's the place.

-Do you think maybe he's compensating for something?

{Laughs}

{Groans}

-Hey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.

-Hurry, darling. We're late. Hurry.

-Hey, you!

{Screams}

-Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - -

{Whimpering}

{Sighs}

{Whimpering, Groans}

{Turnstile clatters}

{Chuckles}

{Sighs}

-It's quiet. Too quiet.

{Creaking}

-Where is everybody?

-Hey, look at this!

{Clattering, whirring, clicking}

Welcome to DuLoc such a perfect town

Here we have some rules

Let us lay them down

Don't make waves, stay in line

And we'll get along fine

DuLoc is perfect place

Please keep off of the grass

Shine your shoes, wipe your... face

DuLoc is, DuLoc is

DuLoc is perfect ...... place

{Camera shutter clicks

{Whirring}

-Wow! Let's do that again!

-No. No. No, no, no! No.

{Trumpet fanfare}

{Crowd cheering}

-Brave knights.

-You are the best and brightest in all the land.

-Today one of you shall prove himself - -

-All right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom.

-Sorry about that.

{Cheering}

-That champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go 

forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the 

dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first 

runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you mae 

die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make.

{Cheering}

-Let the tournament begin!

{Gasps}

-Oh!

-What is that?

{Gasping}

-It's hideous!

-Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey.

-Indeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the orge will be named 

champion! Have it him!

-Get him!

-Oh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now.

-Go ahead! Get him!

-Can't we just settle this over a pint?

-Kill the beast!

-No? All right then. Come on!



I don't give a damn about my reputation

You're living in the past 

It's a new generation



-Damn!

{Whinnying}



A girl can do what she wants to do

And that's what I'm gonna do

And I don't give a damn about my bad reputation

Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Not me

Me, me, me



-Hey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me!



And I don't give a damn about my bad reputation

Never said I wanted to improve my station



-Ah!

{Laughs}



And I'm always feelin' good when I'm having fun



-Yeah!



And I don't have to please no one



-The chair! Give him the chair!



And I don't give a damn about my bad reputation

Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Not me

Me, me, me

Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Not me, not me

{Bell dings}

{Cheering}

{Laughs}

-Oh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till 

Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha!

{Shrek laughs}

{Crowd gasping, murmuring}

-Shall I give the order, sir?

-No, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion!

-What?

-Congratulations, orge. You're won the honor of embarking on a great 

and noble quest.

-Quest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back.

-Your swamp?

-Yeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those tale creatures!

{Crowd murmuring}

-Indeed. All right, orge. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for 

me, and I'll give you your swamp back.

-Exactly the way it was?

-Down to the last slime-covered toadstool.

-And the squatters?

-As good as gone.

-What kind of quest?

-Let me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a 

princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only 

don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place.

-Is that about right?

-Maybe there's a good reason donkeys shouldn't talk.

-I don't get it. Why don't you just pull some of that orge stuff on 

him? Throttle him, lay siege to his fortress, grinds his bones to make 

your bread, the whole orge trip.

-Oh, I know what. Maybe I could have decapitated an entire village and 

put their heads on a pike, gotten a knife, cut open their spleen and 

drink their fluids. Does that sound good to you?

-Uh, no, not really, no.

-For your information, there's a lot more to orges than people think.

-Example?

-Example? Okay, um, orges are like onions.

-{Sniffs} They stink?

-Yes - - No!

-They make you cry?

-No!

-You leave them in the sun, they get all brown, start sproutin' little 

white hairs.

-No! Layers! Onions have layers. Orges have layers! Onions have 

layers. You get it? We both have layers. 

{Sighs}

-Oh, you both have layers. Oh. {Sniffs} You know, not everybody likes 

onions. Cake! Everybody loves cakes! Cakes have layers.

-I don't care... what everyone likes. Orges are not like cakes.

-You know what else everybody likes? Parfaits. Have you ever met a 

person, you say, "Let's get some parfait," they say, "No, I don't like 

no parfait"? Parfaits are delicious.

-No! You dense, irritating, miniature beast of burden! Orges are like 

onions! And of story. Bye-bye. See ya later.

-Parfaits may be the most delicious thing on the whole damn planet.

-You know, I think I preferred your humming. Do you have a tissure or 

something? I'm making a mess. Just the word parfait make me start 

slobbering.



I'm on my way from misery to happiness today

Uh-huh,uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh

I'm on my way from misery to happiness today

Uh-huh,uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh

And everything that you receive up yonder

Is what you give to me the day I wander

I'm on my way 

I'm on my way 

I'm on my way 



-Ohh! Shrek! Did you do that?

-You gotta warn somebody before you just crack one off. My mouth was 

open. Believe me, Donkey, if it was me, you'd be dead. {Sniffs} It's 

brimstone We must be getting close.

-Yeah, right, brimstone. Don't be talking about it's the brimstone. I 

know what I smell. It wasn't no brimstone. It didn't come off no stone 

neither.

{Rumbling}

-Sure, it's big enough, but look at the location.

{Laughing}

-Uh, Shrek? Uh, remember when you said orges have layers?

-Oh, aye.

-Well, I have a bit of a confession to make. Donkeys don't have 

layers. We wear our fear right out there on our sleeves.

-Wait a second.  Donkeys don't have sleeves.

-You know what I mean.

-You can't tell me you're afraid of heights.

-I'm just a little uncomfortable about being on a rickety bridge over 

a boiling like of lava!

-Come on, Donkey. I'm right here beside ya, okay? For emotional 

support., we'll just tackle this thing together one little baby step 

at a time.

-Really?

-Really, really.

-Okay, that makes me feel so much better.

-Just keep moving. And don't look  down.

-Okay, don't look  down. Don't look  down. Don't look  down. Keep on 

moving. Don't look  down.

{Gasps}

-Shrek! I'm lookin' down! Oh, God, I can't do this! Just let me off, 

please! 

-But you're already halfway.

-But I know that half is safe!

-Okay, fine. I don't have time for this. You go back.

-Shrek, no! Wait!

-Just, Donkey - - Let's have a dance then, shall me?

-Don't do that!

-Oh, I'm sorry. Do what?

-Oh, this?

-Yes, that!

-Yes? Yes, do it. Okay.

{Screams}

-No, Shrek! No! Stop it!

-You said do it! I'm doin' it.

-I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. Shrek, I'm gonna die. Oh!

-That'll do, Donkey. That'll do.

-Cool.

-So where is this fire-breathing pain-in-the-neck anyway?

-Inside, waiting for us to rescue her.

{Chuckles}

-I was talkin' about the dragon, Shrek.

{Water dripping, wind howling}

-You afraid?

-No.

-But - -

- Shh.

-Oh, good. Me neither.

{Gasps}

-'Cause there's nothin' wrong with bein' afraid. Fear's a sensible 

response to an unfamiliar situation. Unfamiliar dangerous situation, I 

might add. With a dragon that breathes fire and eats knights and 

breathes fire, it sure doesn't mean you're a coward if you're a little 

scared. I sure as heck ain't no coward. I know that.

{Gasps}

-Donkey, two things, okay? Shut ... up. Now go over there and see if 

you can find any stairs.

-Stairs? I thought we was lookin' for the princess.

-The princess will be up the stairs in the highest room in the tallest 

tower.

-What makes you think she'll be there?

-I read it in a book once.

-Cool. You handle the dragon. I'll handle the stairs. I'll find those 

stairs. I'll whip their butt too. Those stairs won't know which way 

they're goin'.

{Creacing}

-I'm gonna take drastic steps. Kick it to the curb. Don't mess with 

me. I'm the stair master. I've mastered the stairs. I wish I had a 

step right here. I'd step all over it.

-Well, at least we know where the princess is, but where's the - - 

-Dragon!

{Screams}

{Gasps}

{Roars}

-Donkey, look out!

{Screams}

{Whimpering}

-Got ya!

{Roars}

{Gasps}

{Shouts}

-Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

{Screaming}

{Gasps}

-Oh! Aah! Aah!

{Gasping}

{Crowls}

-No. Oh, no, No!

{Screams}

-Oh, what large teeth you have.

{Crowls}

-I mean white, sparkling teeth. I know you probably hear this all time 

from your food, but you must bleach, 'cause that is one dazzling smile 

you got  there. Do I detect a hint of minty freshness? And you know 

what else? You're - - You're a girl dragon! Oh, sure! I mean, of 

course you're a girl dragon. You're just reeking of feminine beauty. 

What's the matter with you? You got something in your eye? Ohh. Oh. 

Oh. Man, I'd really love to stay, but you know, I'm, uh - - 

(Coughs)

-I'm an asthmatic, and I don't know if it'd work out if you're gonna 

blow smoke rings. Shrek!

{Gasps}

{Whimpering}

-No! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

{Groans, Sighs}

{Vocalizing}

-Oh! Oh!

-Wake up!

-What?

-Are you Princess Fiona?

-I am, awaiting a knight so bold as to rescue me.

-Oh, that's nice. Now let's go!

-But wait, Sir Knight. This be-ith our first meeting. Should it not be 

a wonderful, romantic moment?

-Yeah, sorry, lady. There's no time.

-Hey, wait. What are you doing? You should sweep me off my feet out 

yonder window and down a rope onto your valiant steed.

-You've had a lot of time to plan this, haven't you?

-Mm-hmm.

{Screams, grunts}

-But we have to savor this moment! You could recite an epic poem for 

me. A ballad? A sonnet! A limerick? Or something!

-I don't think so.

-Can I at least know the name of my champion?

-Um, Shrek.

-Sir Shrek.

{Cleans throat}

-I pray that you take this favor as a token of my gratitude.

-Thanks!

{Roaring}

-You didn't slay the dragon?

-It's on my to-do list. Now come on!

{Screams}

-But this isn't right! You were meant to charge in, sword drawn, 

banner flying. That's what all the other knights did.

-Yeah, right before they burst into flame.

-That's not the point. Oh!

-Wait. Where are you going? The next's over there.

-Well, I have to save my ass.

-What kind of knight are you?

-One of a kind.

-Slow down. Slow down, baby, please. I believe it's healthy to get to 

know someone over a long perriod of time. Just call me old-fashioned. 

{Laughs}

-I don't want to rush into a physical relationship. I'm not 

emotionally ready for a commitment of, uh, this - -  Magnitude really 

is the word I'm looking for. Magnitude- - Hey, that is unwanted 

physical contact. Hey, what are you doing? Okay, okay. Let's just back 

up a little and take this one step at a time. We really should get to 

know each other first as friends or pen pals. I'm on the road a lot, 

but I just love receiving cards - -  I'd really love to stay, but - - 

Don't do that! That's my tail! That's my personal tail. You're gonna 

tear it off. I don't give permission - - What are you gonna do with 

that? Hey, now. No way. No! No! No, no! No. No, no, no. No! Oh!

{Growls}

{Roaring}

{Gasps}

-Hi, Princess!

-It talks!

-Yeah, it's getting him to shut up that's the trick.

{Screams}

{Screaming}

-Oh!

{Thuds}

{Groans}

{Roars}

{Roaring}

-Okay, you two, heard for the exit! I'll take care of the dragon.

{Fchoing}

-Run!

{Gasping}

{Screaming}

{Roaring}

{Screams}

{Roars}

{Panting, sighs}

{Whimpers}

{Roars}

-You did it!

-You rescued me! You're amazing. You're - - You're wonderful. 

You're... a little unorthodox I'll admit. But they deed is great, and 

thine heart is pure. I am eternally in your debt. 

{Clears throat}

-And where would a brave knight be without his noble steed?

-I hope you heard that. She called me a noble steed. She think I'm a 

steed.

-The battle is won. You may remove your helmet, good Sir Knight.

-Uh, no.

-Why not?

-I have helmet hair.

-Please. I would'st look upon the face of my rescuer.

-No, no, you wouldn't - - 'st.

-But how will you kiss me?

-What? That wasn't in the job description.

-Maybe it's a perk.

-No, it's destiny. Oh, you must know how it goes. A princess locked in 

a tower and beset by a dragon is rescued by a brave knight, and then 

they share true love's first kiss.

-Hmm? With Shrek? You think- - Wait. Wait. You think that Shrek is you 

true love?

-Well, yes.

{Laughing}

-You think Shrek is your true love!

-What is so funny?

-Let's just say I'm not your tipe, okay?

-Of course, you are. You're my rescuer. Now - - Now remove your 

helmet.

-Look. I really don't think this is a good idea.

-Just take off the helmet.

-I'm not going to.

-Take ot off.

-No!

-Now!

-Okay! Easy. As you command. Your Highness.

-You- - You're a- - an orge.

-Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming.

-Well, yes, actually. Oh, no. This is all wrong. You're not supposed 

to be an orge.

{Sighs}

-Princess, I was sent to rescue you by Lord Farquaad, okay? He is the 

one who wants to marry you.

-Then why didn't he come rescue me?

-Good question. You should ask him that when we get there.

-But I have to be rescued by my true love, not by some prge and his- - 

his pet.

-So much for noble steed.

-You're not making my job any easier.

-I'm sorry, but your job is not my problem. You can tell Lord Farquaad 

that if he wants to rescue me properly, I'll be waiting for him right 

here.

-Hey! I'm no one's messenger boy, all right? I'm a delivery boy.

-You wouldn't dare. Put me down!

-Ya comin', Donkey?

-I'm right behind ya.

-Put me down, or you will suffer the consequences! This is not 

dignified! Put me down!

-Okay, so here's another question. Say there's a woman that digs you, 

right, but you don't really like her that way. How do you let her down 

real easy so her feelings aren't hurt, but you don't get burned to a 

crisp and eaten?

-You just tell her she's not your true love. Everyone knowest what 

happens when you find your - -  Hey!

{Sighs}

-The sooner we get to DuLoc the better.

-You're gonna love it there, Princess. It's beautiful!

-And what of my groom-to-be? Lord Farquaad? What's he like?

-Let me put it this way, Princess. Men of Farquaad's stature are in 

short supply.

{Laughs}

-I don't know. There are those who think little of him.

-Stop it. Stop it, both of you. You're just jealous you can never 

measure up to a great ruler like Lord Farquaad.

-Yeah, well, maybe you're right, Princess. But I'll let you do the 

"measuring" when you see him tomorrow.

-Tomorrow? It'll take that long? Shouldn't we stop to make camp?

-No, that'll take longer. We can keep going.

-But there's robbers in the woods.

-Whoa! Time out, Shrek! Camping's starting to sound good.

-Hey, come on. I'm scarier than anything we're going to see in this 

forest.

-I need to find somewhere to camp now!

{Birds wings fluttering}

{Grunting}

-Hey! Over here.

-Shrek, we can do better than that. I don't think this is fit for a 

princess.

-No, no, it's perfect. It just needs a few homey touches.

-Homey touches? Like what?

{Crashing}

-A door? Well, gentlemen, I bid thee good night.

-You want me to read you a bedtime story? I will.

-I said good night!

-Shrek, What are you doing?

{Laughs}

-I just- - You know - - Oh, come on. I was just kidding.

{Fire cracking}

-And, uh, that one, that's Throwback, the only orge to ever spit over 

three wheat fields. Right. Yeah.

-Hey, can you tell my future from these stars?

-The stars don't tell the future, Donkey. They tell stories. Look, 

there's Bloodnut, the Flatulent. You can guess what he's famous for.

-I know you're making this up.

-No, look. There he is,  and there's the group of hunters running away 

from his stench.

-That ain't nothin' but a bunch of little dots.

-You know, Donkey, sometimes things are more than they appear. Hmm? 

Forget it.

{Sighs}

-Hey, Shrek, what we gonna do when we get our swamp anyway?

-Our swamp?

-You know, when we're through rescuing the princess.

-We? Donkey, there's no "we". There's no "our". There's just me and my 

swamp. The first thing I'm gonna do is build a ten-foot wall arond my 

land.

-You cut me deep, Shrek. You cut me real deep just now. You know what 

I think? I think this whole wall thing is just a way to keep somebody 

out.

-No, do ya think?

-Are you hidin' something?

-Never mind, Donkey.

-Oh, this is another one of those onion things, isn't it?

-No, this is one of those drop-it and leave-it alone things.

-Why don't you want to talk about it?

-Why do you want to talk about it?

-Why are you blocking?

-I'm not blocking.

-Oh, yes, you are.

-Donkey, I'm warning you.

-Who you trying to keep out?

-Everyone! Okay?

-Oh, now we're gettin' somewhere.

-Oh! For the love of Pete!

-What's your problem? What you got against the whole world anyway?

-Look, I'm not the one with the problem, okay? It's the world that 

seems to have a problem with me. People take one look at me and go. 

"Aah! Help! Run! A big, stupid, ugly orge!" They judge me before they 

even know me. That's why I'm better off alone.

-You know what? When we met, I didn't think you was just a big, 

stupid, ugly orge.

-Yeah, I know.

-So, uh, are there any donkeys up there?

-Well, there's, um, Gabby, the Small and Annoying.

-Okay, okay, I see it now. The big shiny one, right there. That one 

there?

-That's the moon.

-Oh, okay.



{Orchestra}

{Dulcimer}

-Again, show me again. Mirror, mirror, show her to me. Show me the 

princess.

-Hmph.

-Ah. Perfect.

{Sizzling}

{Sniffs, yawns}

-Mmm, yeah, you know I like it like that.

--Come on, baby. I said I like it.

-Donkey, wake up.

-Huh? What?

-Wake up.

-What?

-Good morning. Hm, how do you like your eggs?

-Good morning, Princess!

-What's all this about?

-You know, we kind of got off to a bad start yesterday. I wanted to 

make it up to you. I mean, after all, you did rescue me.

-Uh, thanks.

{Sniffs}

-Well, eat up. We've got a big day ahead of us.

{Belches}

-Shrek!

-What? It's a compliment. Better out than in, I always say. {Laughs}

-Well, it's no way to behave in front of a princess.

{Belches}

-Thanks.

-She's as nasty as you are.

-{Laughs} You know, you're not exactly what I expected.

-Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people before you get to know them.

{Vocalizing}



-La liberte! Hey!

-Princess!

{Laughs}

-What are you doing?

-Be still, mon cherie, for I am you savior! And I am rescuing you from 

this green - -

{Kissing sounds}

-beast.

-Hey!

-That's my princess! Go find you own!

-Please, monster! Can't you see I'm a little busy here?

-Look, pal, I don't know who you think you are!

-Oh! Of couse! Oh, how rude. Please let me introduse myself. Oh, Merry 

Men. 

{Laughs}



{Accordion}

Ta, dah, dah, dah, whoo.

I steal from the rich and give to the needy.

He takes a wee percentage, 

But I'm not greedy. I rescue pretty damsels

Man, I'm good

What a guy, Monsieur Hood

Break it down

I like an honest fight

and a saucy little maid

What he's basically saying

is he likes to get - - 

Paid

So

When an orge in the bush

grabs a lady by the tush

That's bad

That's bad

When a beauty's with a beast

it makes me awfully mad

He's mad

He's really, really mad

I'll take my blade and

ram it through your heart

Keep your eyes on me, boys

'cause I'm about to start



{Grunts, Groans}

{Karate Yell}

{Merry Men Gasping}

-Man, that was annoying!

-Oh, you little- - 

{Karate Yell}

{Accordion}

{Shouting, groaning}

{Chuckles}

-Uh, shall we?

-Hold the phone.

{Grunts}

Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on now. Where did that come from?

-What?

-That! Back there. That was amazing! Where did you learn that?

-Well - - {Chuckles} When one lives alone, uh, one has to learn these 

things in case there's a - - There's an arrow in your butt!

-What? Oh, would you look at that?

-Oh, no. This is all my fault. I'm so sorry.

-Why? What's wrong?

-Shrek's hurt.

-Shrek's hurt. Shrek's hurt? Oh, no, Shrek's gonna die.

-Donkey, I'm okay.

-You can't do this to me, Shrek. I'm too young for you to die. Keep 

you legs elevated. Turn your head and cough. Does anyone know the 

Heimlich?

-Donkey! Calm down. If you want to help Shrek, run into the woods and 

find me a blue flower with red thorns.

-Blue flower, red thorns. Okay, I'm on it. Blue flower, red thorns. 

Don't die Shrek. If you see a long tunnel, stay away from the light!

-{Both} Donkey!

-Oh, yeah. Right. Blue flower, red thorns.

-What are the flowers for?

-For getting rid of Donkey.

-Ah.

-Now you hold still, and I'll yank this thing out.

-Ow! Hey! Easy with the yankin'.

-I'm sorry, but it has to come out.

-No, it's tender.

-Now, hold on.

-What you're doing is the opposite of help.

-Don't move.

-Look, time out.

-Would you - - 

{Grunts}

-Okay. What do you propose we do?

-Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red 

thorns. This would be so much easier if I wasn't color-blind! Blue 

flower, red thorns.

-Ow!

-Hold on, Shrek! I'm comin'!

-Ow! Not good.

-Okay. Okay. I can nearly see the head.

{Grunts}

-It's just about - - 

-Ow! Ohh!

-Ahem.

-Nothing happend. We were just, uh - - 

-Look, if you wanted to be alone, all you had to do was ask. Okay?

-Oh, come on! That's the last thing on my mind. The princess here was 

just- - Ugh! 

-Ow!

-Hey, what's that?

{Nervous chickle}

-That's- - Is that blood?

{Sighs}

{Bird chirping}

{Grunts}



My beloved monster and me

We go everywhere together

Wearin' a raincoat

that has four sleeves

Gets us through all kinds of weather



-Aah!



She will always be the only thing

That comes between me and the awful sting

That comes from living in a world

that's so damn mean

{Croaks}

Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

-Hey!

La-la, la-la, la-la-la-la

{Both laughing}

La-la, la-la, la-la



-There it is, Princess. Your future awaits you.

-That's DuLoc?

-Yeah, I know. You know, Shrek thinks Lord Farquaad's compensating for 

something,  which I think means he has a really - - Ow!

-Um, I, uh- -  I guess we better move on.

-Sure. But, Shrek? I'm - - I'm worried about Donkey.

{Blubbering}

-What?

-I mean, look at him. He doesn't look so good. 

-What are you talking about? I'm fine.

-That's what they always say, and then next thing you know, you're on 

your back. Dead.

-You know, she's right. You look awful. Do you want to sit down?

-Uh, you know, I'll make you some tea.

-I didn't want to say nothin', but I got this twinge in my neck, and 

when I turn my head like this, look, 

{Bones crunch}

-Ow! See?

-Who's hungry? I'll find us some dinner.

-I'll get the firewood.

-Hey, where you goin'? Oh, man, I can't feel my toes! I don't have any 

toes! I think I need a hug.



-Mmm. This is good. This is really good. What is this?

-Uh, weedrat. Rotisserie style.

-No kidding. Well, this is delicious.

-Well, they're also great in stews. Now, I don't mean to brag, but I 

make a mean weedrat stew.

{Chuckling}

{Sighs}

-I guess I'll be dining a little differently tomorrow night.

{Gulps}

-Maybe you can come visit me in the swamp sometime. I'll cook all kind 

of stuff for you. Swamp toad soup, fish eye tartare - - you name it.

{Chuckles}

-I'd like that.

{Slurps, laughs}



See the pyramids along the Nile



-Um, Princess?



Watch the sunrise from a tropic isle



-Yes, Shrek?

-I, um, I was wondering.



Just remember, darling all the while



-Are you- - 



You belong to me



{Sighs} 

-Are you gonna eat that?

{Chuckles}

-Man, isn't this romantic? Just look at that sunset.

-Sunset?

-Oh, no! I mean, it's late. I-It's very late.

-What?

-Wait a minute. I see what's goin' on here. You're afraid of the dark, 

aren't you?

-Yes! Yes, that's it. I'm terrified. You know, I'd better go inside.

-Don't feel bad, Princess. I used to be afraid of the dark, too, until 

- - Hey, no, wait. I'm still afraid of the dark.

{Shrek sighs}

 -Good night.

 -Good night.

{Door creaks}

-Ohh! Now I really see what's goin' on here.

-Oh, what are you talkin' about?

-I don't even wanna hear it. Look, I'm an animal, and I got instincts. 

And I know you two were diggin' on each other. I could feel it.

-You're crazy. I'm just bringing her back to Farquaad.

-Oh, come on, Shrek. Wake up and smell the pheromones. Just go on in 

and tell her how you feel.

-I- - There's nothing to tell. Besides, even if I did tell her that, 

well, you know - - and I'm not sayin' I do 'cause I don't - - she's a 

princess, and I'm - - 

-An orge?

-Yeah. An orge.

-Hey, where you goin'?

-To get... move firewood.

{Sighs} 



-Princess? Princess Fiona? Princess, where are you?

{Wings fluttering}

-Princess?

{Creaking}

{Gasps}

-It's very spooky in here. I ain't playing no games.

{Screams}

-Aah!

-Oh, no!

-No, help!

-Shh!

-Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

-No, it's okay. It's okay.

-What did you do with the princess?

-Donkey, I'm the princess.

-Aah!

-It's me, in this body.

-Oh, my God! You ate the princess. Can you hear me?

-Donkey!

-Listen, keep breathing! I'll get you out of there!

-No!

-Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

-Shh.

-Shrek!

-This is me.

{Muffled mumbling}

-Princess? What happened to you? You're, uh, uh, uh, different.

-I'm ugly, okay?

-Well, yeah! Was it something you ate? 'Cause I told Shrek those rats 

was a bad idea. You are what you eat, I said. Now - - 

-No.

-I - - I've been this way as long as I can remember.

-What do you mean? Look, I ain't never seen you like this before.

-It's only happens when sun goes down.

"By night one way, by day another. This shall be the norm... until you 

find true love's first kiss... and then take love's true form."

-Ah, that's beautiful. I didn't know you wrote poetry.

-It's a spell.

{Sighs} 

-When I was a little girl, a witch cast a spell on me. Every night I 

become this. This horrible, ugly beast! I was placed in a tower to 

await the day my true love would rescue me. That's why I have to marry 

Lord Farquaad tomorrow before the sun sets and he sees me like this.

{Sobs}

-All right, all right. Calm down. Look, it's not that bad. You're not 

that ugly. Well, I ain't gonna lie. You are ugly. But you only look 

like this at night. Shrek's ugly 24-7.

-But Donkey, I'm a princess, and this is not how a princess is meant 

to look.

-Princess, how 'bout if you don't marry Farquaad?

-I have to.  Only my true love's kiss can break the spell.

-But, you know, um, you're kind of an orge, and Shrek - - well, you 

got a lot in common.

-Shrek?



-Princess, I - - Uh, how's it going, first of all? Good? Um, good for 

me too. I'm okay. I saw this flower and thought of you because it's 

pretty and - - well, I don't really like it, but I thought you might 

like it 'cause you're pretty. But I like you anyway. I'd - - uh, uh - 

- 

{Sighs}

-I'm in trouble. Okay, here we go.

-I can't just marry whoever I want. Take a good look at me, Donkey. I 

mean, really, who can ever love a beast so hideous and ugly? 

"Princess" and "ugly" don't go together. That's why I can't stay here 

with Shrek.

{Gasps}

-My only chance to live happily ever after is to marry my true love.

{Deep sigh}

-Don't you see, Donkey? That's just how it has to be. It's the only 

way to break the spell.

-You at least gotta tell Shrek the truth.

-No! You can't breathe a word. No one must ever know.

-What's the point of being able to talk if you gotta keep secrets?

-Promise you won't tell. Promise!

-All right, all right. I won't tell him. But you should. I just know 

before this is over, I'm gonna need a whole lot of serious therapy.

-Look at my eye twitchin'.

{Door opens}

{Snoring}

-I tell him, I tell him not. I tell him, I tell him not. I tell him. 

-Shrek! Shrek, there's something I want - - 

{Snoring}

-Shrek. Are you all right?

-Perfect! Never been better.

-I - - I don't - - There's something I have to tell you.

-You don't have to tell me anything, Princess. I heard enough last 

night.

-You heard what I said?

-Every word.

-I thought you'd understand.

-Oh, I undersatnd. Like you said, "Who could love a hideous, ugly 

beast?" 

-But I thought that wouldn't matter to you.

-Yeah? Well, it does.

{Gasps, sighs}

-Ah, right on time.

{Horse whinnies}

-Princess, I've brought you a little something.

{Fanfare}

{Yawns}

-What'd I miss? What'd I miss?

{Muffled}

-Who said that? Couldn't have been a donkey.

-Princess Fiona.

-As promised. Now hand it over.

-Very well, orge. The deed to your swamp, cleared out, as agreed.

-Take it and go before I change my mind.

-Forgive me, Princess, for startling you, but you startled me, for I 

have never seen such a radiant beauty before. I'm Lord Farquaad.

-Lord Farquaad? Oh, no, no.

{Snaps fingers}

-Forgive me, my lord, for I was just saying a short... farewell.

-Oh, that is so sweet. You don't have to waste good manners on the 

orge. It's not like it has feelings.

-No, you're right. It doesn't.

-Princess Fiona, beautiful, fair, flawerss Fiona. I ask your hand in 

marriage.

{Gasps}

-Will you be the perfect bride for the perfect groom?

-Lord Farquaad, I accept. Nothing would make - - 

-Excellent! I'll start the plans, for tomorrow we wed!

-No! I mean, uh, why wait? Let's get married today before the sun 

sets.

-Oh, anxious, are you? You're right. The sooner, the better. There's 

so much to do! Threre's the caterer, the cake, the band, the guest 

list. Captain, round up some guests!

-Fare-thee-well, orge.

-Shrek, what are you doing? You're letting her get away.

-Yeah? So what?

-Shrek, there's something about her you don't know. Look, I talked to 

her last night, She's - - 

-I know you talked to her last night. You're great pals, aren't ya? 

Now, if you two are such good friends, why don't you follow her home?

-Shrek, I - - I wanna go with you.

-I told you, didn't I? You're not coming home with me. I live alone! 

My swamp! Me! Nobody else! Understand? Nobody! Especially useless, 

pathetic, annoying, talking donkeys!

-But I thought - - 

-Yeah. You know what? You tought wrong!

-Shrek.



I heard there was a secret chord

That David played and it pleased the Lord

But you don't really care for music, do ya

It goes like this the fourth, the fifth

The minor fall the major lift

The baffled king composing hallelujah

Hallelujah,  hallelujah

Baby, I've been here before

I know this room I've walked this floor

I used to live alone before I knew you

I've seen your flag on the marble arch

But love is not a victory march

It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

Hallelujah,  hallelujah

And all I ever learned from love

Is how to shoot at someone

Who outdrew you

{Moaning}

And it's not a cry you can hear at night

It's not somebody who's seen the light

It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

{Moaning}

Hallelujah,  hallelujah



{Thumping sound}

-Donkey?

{Grunts}

-What are you doing?

-I would think, of all people, you would recognize a wall when you see 

one.

-Well, yeah. But the wall's supposed to go around my swamp, not 

through it.

-It is around your half. See that's your half, and this is my half.

-Oh! Your half. Hmm.

-Yes, my half. I helped rescue the princess. I did half the work. I 

get half the booty. Now hand me that big old rock, the one that looks 

like your head.

-Back off!

-No, you back off.

-This is my swamp!

-Our swamp.

-Let go, Donkey!

-You let go.

-Stubborn jackass!

-Smelly orge.

-Fine!

-Hey, hey, come back here. I'm not through with you yet.

-Well, I'm through with you.

-Uh-uh. You know, with you it's always, "Me, me, me!" Well, guess 

what! Now it's my turn! So you just shut up and pay attention! You are 

mean to me. You insult me and you don't appreciate anything that I do! 

You're always pushing me around or pushing me away.

-Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you so bad, how come you came back?

-Because that's what friends do! They forgive each other!

-Oh, yeah. You're right, Donkey. I forgive you... for stabbin' me in 

the back!

-Ohh! You're so wrapped up in layers, onion boy, you're afraid of your 

own feelings.

-Go away!

-There you are , doing it again just like you did to Fiona. All she 

ever do was like you, maybe even love you.

-Love me? She said I was ugly, a hideous creature. I heard the two of 

you talking. 

-She wasn't talkin' about you. She was talkin' about, uh, somebody 

else.

-She wasn't talking about me? Well, then who was she talking about?

-Uh-uh, no way. I ain't saying anything. You don't wanna listen to me. 

Right? Right?

-Donkey!

-No!

-Okay, look. I'm sorry, all right?

{Sighs}

-I'm sorry. I guess I am just a big, stupid, ugly orge. Can you 

forgive me?

-Hey, that's what friends are for, right?

-Right. Friends?

-Friends.

-So, um, what did Fiona say about me?

-What are you asking me for? Why don't you just go ask her?

-The wedding! We'll never make it in time.

-Ha-ha-ha! Never fear, for where, there's a will, there's a way and I 

have a way.

{Whistles}

-Donkey?

-I guess it's just my animal magnetism.

{Laughing}

-Aw, come here, you.

-All right, all right.Don't get all slobbery. No one likes a kiss ass. 

All right, hop on and hold on tight. I haven't had a chance to install 

the seat belts yet.

-Whoo!

{Bells tolling}

{All gasping}

-People of DuLoc, we gather here today to bear witnss to the union....

-Um-

-of our new king - -

-Excuse me. Could we just skip ahead to the "I do's"?

{Chuckling}

-Go on.

-Go ahead, HAVE SOME FUN. If we need you, I'll whistle. How about 

that? Shrek, wait, wait! Wait a minute! You wanna do this right, don't 

you?

-What are you talking about?

-There's a line you gotta wait for. The preacher's gonna say, "Speak 

now or forever hold your peace." That's when you say, "I object!"

-I don't have time for this!

-Hey, wait. What are you doing? Listen to me! Look, you love this 

woman, don't you?

-Yes.

-You wanna hold her?

-Yes.

-Please her?

-Yes!

-Then you got to, got to try a little tenderness. The chicks love that 

romantic crap!

-All right! Cut it out. When does this guy say the line?

-We gotta check it out.



-And so, by the power vested in me, 

-What do you see?

-The whole town's in there.

-I now pronounce you husband and wife,

-They're at the altar.

-king and queen.

-Mother Fletcher! He already said it.

-Oh, for the love of Pete!

{Grunts}

-I object!

-Shrek?

{Gasps}

-Oh, now what does he want?

-Hi, everyone. Havin' a good time, are ya? I love DuLoc, first at all. 

Very clean.

-What are you doing here?

-Really, it's rude enough being alive when no one wants you, but 

showing up uninvited to a wedding - -

-Fiona! I need to talk to you.

-Oh, now you wanna talk? It's a little late for that, so if you'll 

excuse me - - 

-But you can't marry him.

-And why not?

-Because- - Because he's just marring you so he can be king.

-Outrageous! Fiona, don't listen to him.

-He's not your true love.

-And what do you know about true love?

-Well, I - - Uh - - I mean - - 

-Oh, this is precious. The orge has fallen in love with the princess! 

Oh, good Lord.

{Crowd laughting}

-An orge and a princess!

-Shrek, is this true?

-Who cares? It's preposterous! Fiona, my love, we're but a kiss away 

from our "happily ever after." Now kiss me! Mmmmm!

-"By night one way, by day another." I wanted to show you before.

{Whimpers}

{Crown gasping}

-Well, uh, that explains a lot.

-Ugh! It's disgusting! Guards! Guards! I order you to get that out of 

my sight now! Get them! Get them both!

-No, no!

-Shrek!

-This hocus-pocus alters nothing. This marriage is binding, and that 

makes me king! See? See?

-No, let go of me! Shrek!

-No!

-Don't just stand there, you morons.

-Get out of my way! Fiona! Arrgh! 

-I'll make you regret the day we met. I'll see you drawn and 

quartered!

-You'll beg for death to save you!

-No, Shrek!

-And as for you, my wife,

-Fiona!

-I'll have you locked back in that tower for the rest of your days!

-I'm king!

{Whistles}

-I will have order! I will have perfection! I will have - - Aaaah!

-Aah!

-All right. Nobody move. I got a dragon here, and I'm not afraid to 

use it.

{Roars}

-I'm a donkey on the edge!

{Belches}

-Celebrity marriages. They never last, do they?

{Cheering}

-Go ahead, Shrek.

-Uh, Fiona?

-Yes, Shrek?

-I - - I love you.

-Really?

-Really, really.

- I love you too.

-Aawww!

-"Until you find true love's first kiss and then take love's true 

form."

-"Take love's true form. Take love's true form."

-Fiona? Fiona. Are you all right?

-Well, yes. But I don't understand. I'm supposed to be beautiful.

-But you ARE beautiful.

{Chuckles}

-I was hoping this would be a happy ending.



I thought love was only true in fairy tales

Oy!

Meant for someone else but not for me

Love was out to get me

That's the way it seemed

Disappointment haunted all my dreams

And then I saw her face

Now I'm a believer and not a trace

Of doubt in my mind

I'm in love

Ooh-aah

I'm a believer I couldn't leave her

If I tried



-God bless us, every one.



Come on, y'all!

Then I saw her face

Ha-ha

Now I'm a believer 

Listen!

Not a trace

Of doubt in my mind

I'm in love

Ooh-aah

I'm a believer 

I couldn't leave her if I tried

-Ooh!

-Uh!

Then I saw her face

Now I'm a believer 

Hey!

Not a trace

Uhh! Yeah.

Of doubt in my mind



-One more time!

I'm in love

I'm a believer 

Come on!

I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe, 

I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe, hey

Y'all sing it with me!
