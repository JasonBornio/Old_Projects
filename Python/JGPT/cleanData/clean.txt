a unifying component of the plot accompanying gokus progression as a martial artist is his search for the eponymous dragon balls
they are one component of the universe but are not the focus of most of the plot lines of the title
the dragon balls themselves are seven magical orbs which are scattered across the world
when assembled they can be used to summon shenron the dragon who will grant one wish within it's limit
after the wish is granted the dragon balls are scattered again across the world and become inert for one year
in times past it would take generations to search the world and gather the dragon balls
at the beginning of the story however a 16yearold genius girl named bulma invents a dragon radar to detect the dragon balls and makes the process far easier than it was originally intended to be
the story of dragon ball unfolds gradually over 11 years of publication
the tone and the style of the stories gradually changes to reflect the tastes of the readers and the editors of shōnen jump in japan
the early volumes of the manga are primarily humorous fantasy stories but they contain some minor scifi elements much like dr
notable fantasy elements include not only the monkey boy goku and the dragon balls themselves but also many talking animal characters unlikely martial art techniques and identifying characters as gods and demons
despite the fantasy elements the world does contain highly advanced technology including hoipoi capsules spacesaving capsules which are pocket sized but can store almost any object and other near future
the overall mood of the earlier volumes is light with few deaths and an emphasis on adventure and humor
a subtle but significan't change in mood begins after gokus best friend krillin is killed 
this begins the king piccolo arc in which the manga enters a darker tone compared to it's earlier volumes
this arc would more or less define how later arcs would be structured
dragon ball fully transforms into an action based shōnen manga at the onset of the saiyan arc 
starting with introduction of gokus first son things begin to take a much more serious and harder scifi approach
many characters which were previously implied to have mystic origins including goku and piccolo are revealed to be aliens from other planets
advanced space travel alien threats and powerful cyborgs and androids take center stage instead of more fantastic villains
super saiyan goku as seen in the manga 
after the defeat of vegeta and the conclusion of the saiyan arc the survivors of the vicious saiyan attack head off to the planet namek to resurrect their friends
this begins the frieza arc 
the frieza arc is noteworthy for introducing the first super saiyan now a staple of the series
it also sets the tone for more awesomely powerful characters
for example the antagonist frieza is first said to have a power level
he then transforms into a more powerful form at which point his power level is over 1000000
after two subsequent transformations he reveals that he is still only using a fraction of his full power
the android arc introduces future trunks a mysterious halfsaiyan halfhuman from a destroyed future world where all of the z fighters are killed by evil seemingly unstoppable war machines called androids and the enigmatic and villainous cell who is made from the cells from most of the heroes as well as some of the villains
this arc is notable for being the only arc in which goku does not defeat the main villain instead it is his son gohan who defeats cell
in this arc gohan surpasses the level of super saiyan and reaches the stage of super saiyan 2 in order to defeat cell
after gokus death he is allowed to keep his body and train in the other world
seven years pass and goku gets stronger while gohans power decreases
fortuneteller baba allows goku to return to earth for a single day which marks the start of the majin buu arc which is the final arc of the manga
the beginning of this final arc concentrates on a teenaged gohan
all the male saiyans manage to reach the level of super saiyan at least 
gohan can still use super saiyan 2 while goku and vegeta obtain this transformation as well
and the final level of the super saiyans super saiyan 3 is reached by goku and later gotenks
a considerable number of fusions also take place to add to the series allowing goten and trunks to fuse resulting in gotenks goku and vegeta fuse to create the single most powerful character in dragon ball the invincible vegito
during this series majin buu destroys earth and even manages to increase his own power by absorbing gotenks piccolo and gohan
majin buu also succeeds where the villains vegeta frieza and cell had previously failed and destroys earth
earth and everyone that was on it when it was destroyed are restored using the namekian dragon balls and kid buu is destroyed by gokus spirit bomb only after taking on goku vegeta mr
satan and good buu
kid buu was reincarnated into a human being of pure good called uub and goku vegeta mr
satan and the good buu return to earth and returned to earth to reunite with their friends and families
ten years later goku asks good buu to cheat so goku and uub can have a match after the match goku decides to go to uubs village and train uub to his potential so that one day they can have a match to decide who is the strongest fighter in the universe 
uubs village later receives money from mr
to say goodbye the heroes that appear in the manga everyone waves to the readers and a large the end
sign is seen floating
after completing this series toriyama had a break before making gag manga called nekomajin
this story features many elements and a few characters from dragon ball including characters such as majin buu vegeta and goku
a korean mmorpg that serves as a followup to the manga dragon ball online was developed with bandai namco games and ntl
the game acts as a sequel to the manga with akira toriyama having supervised all aspects of the game from storyline and setting to character and location designs
in a press conference in south korea on february 14 2008 kazuhiko torishima the director of shueisha at the time stated that toriyama had immersed himself in creating character designs and providing editorial supervision for the game for the past five years
two of the main villains of the game mira and towa were created by akira toriyama himself
dragon ball z battle of gods and dragon ball z resurrection ‘f’ have been said to be an expansion to the manga as well as the new arcs of dragon ball super due to toriyamas involvement in the production writing their respective scripts

the captain looks back and sees that the other knights have run away so he too runs away yelling in fear
as the ogre walks away the donkey follows him and compliments him on how great he was with the guards
the donkey says that he dosen't have any friends and asks to stay with the ogre who then tries to scare him away
the donkey just gives him a compliment on how scary that was and sings
the ogre tells the donkey that he is an ogre but the donkey dosen't care

shrek tells the donkey that he is coming with him
the donkey is happy and says shrek and donkey on a whirlwind big city adventure
donkey then starts singing on the road again but shrek makes him hum it instead
in a castle the towns lord walks down a hallway
when he reaches the guards at the end it's obvious that he is a dwarf
he enters the torture chamber where the executioner thelonius is drowning the gingerbread man in a glass of milk
the lord torments the gingerbread man and then crumbles one of his severed legs
he tells the gingerbread man that he and all the other fairy tale trash are monsters that are poisoning his perfect world
he demands that the gingerbread man tell him where the others are and starts to tear off one of his gumdrop buttons
the gingerbread man then rambles on about the muffin man but they are interrupted by knights who bring in the evil queens magic mirror

style cinderella snow white and princess fiona 
upon prompting by thelonius lord farquaad picks princess fiona
the magic mirror then displays princess fiona while playing escape 
lord farquaad says that shes perfect and that finally he will be the perfect king
the magic mirror tries to tell him what happens at night after sunset but he tells the mirror to be quiet
lord farquaad then announces that they are going to have a tournament
shrek and donkey reach the castle at duloc
the parking lot is arranged like the one at disneyland
shrek remarks that it must be lord farquaads castle
it's extremely tall and shrek jokes that he could be compensating for something
as they approach the roped lines for the ticket booth shrek tries to talk to dulocs costumed mascot which looks like lord farquaad but he runs away in fear through the lines
shrek walks straight through the ropes dragging them along as donkey follows and tries to calm the mascot down
the mascot gets knocked out when he runs into the turnstile
shrek and donkey go through the turnstile
elevator music plays in the otherwise quiet and deserted courtyard
the souvenir shop only has lord farquaad items
donkey sees an information booth and pulls the lever
there is some clicking and then the doors open revealing music and wooden puppets that sing the rules for duloc a perfect place
the doors shut and a camera takes shrek and donkeys picture then their photo comes out showing them stunned
shrek and donkey hear fanfare and go in that direction
lord farquaad is high upon a balcony announcing that the tournament winner will have the privilege to go rescue princess fiona
shrek and donkey march past the contestants then farquaad instead tells the knights that the one who kills the ogre will be named champion
shrek bursts open a wine barrel to slip up some knights then slides through the brew swinging at them with one of their axes like a hockey player
donkey climbs onto the other barrel and rolls over some more knights
when more knights arrive shrek jumps into a corral and fights them like a professional wrestler
after a while the crowd cheers for shrek
donkey joins in tag team
style knocking out another knight
after shrek sit's on another knight a woman shouts for shrek to give give him the chair so he whacks him over the head with a chair
after shrek throws the last knight donkey kicks him knocking him out
shrek hams it up for the crowd
lord farquaad signals to the knights with crossbows but instead of giving the order to kill shrek he proclaims that shrek is the champion
farquaad tells shrek that he won the honor to go on the quest
shrek replies that he is already on a quest to get his swamp back where farquaad dumped the fairy tale creatures
farquaad offers a deal to shrek that if he goes on this quest farquaad will give him his swamp back with the squatters gone so shrek agrees
on the way to rescue princess fiona shrek and donkey pass through various vegetable fields
as shrek munches on some vegetables donkey asks shrek why hes going to fight a dragon and rescue a princess to get his swamp back which farquaad filled with freaks
he tells shrek that he should act like an ogre and lay siege to his fortress and grind his bones
shrek sarcastically suggests that instead he could have decapitated some villagers and drank their fluids
shrek tells donkey that theres a lot more to ogres than people think that they are like onions and have layers
shrek and donkey pass a rundown windmill
after two days they finally reach the castle where princess fiona is held up on a mountain
dried lava and brimstone are everywhere
donkey thinks the smell is from shrek but shrek tells donkey that if it were him donkey would be dead
they reach a footbridge over a river of lava leading to the castle
donkey is afraid to cross but shrek backs him up tricking him to cross
inside the castle shrek tells donkey to look for stairs so they can reach princess fiona
shrek puts on some armor of a dead knight
suddenly the dragon breathes fire and chases after donkey
shrek grabs the dragons tail but it shakes him off sending him flying into princess fionas room and waking her up
meanwhile the dragon has donkey trapped
donkey complements it on it's white teeth notices that it's a girl dragon and gives it more appropriate compliments
the dragon picks him up with her teeth and walks happily away
while shrek recovers princess fiona lies back down on the bed and pretends to sleep
shrek approaches her but instead of kissing her he shakes her forcefully and shouts for her to wake up
princess fiona wants romance but shrek keeps his helmet on and drags her down the stairs
down below the dragon is cuddling and romancing donkey
shrek grabs a hanging chain and swings towards the dragon but the chain is stuck up above
he shakes it loose and he falls knocking donkey away as the dragon is about to kiss him
the dragon kisses shreks naked butt
the chains frame falls around the dragons neck like a collar
shrek and donkey run away then shrek grabs donkey and fiona as the dragon chases them repeatedly breathing fire
they crisscross the castle and the chain tangles around all the pillars
shrek locks the chain into the floor with a sword
as they run across the bridge the dragon burns half of it up but they make it safely across
the dragon tries to fly after them but the chain holds it back
safely on the other side fiona demands that shrek remove his helmet and kiss her
he removes his helmet and she is shocked and disappointed that he is an ogre
shrek tells her that lord farquaad sent him that hes the one who wants to marry her
princess fiona tells him in that case that lord farquaad should rescue her and she refuses to leave
shrek picks her up then they head back to duloc
when shrek finally sets fiona down she asks shrek and donkey what duloc and lord farquaad are like
shrek and donkey start making short jokes about him
she says that they are just jealous of him
when she hears that they will get to duloc the next day fiona gets upset and insists that they make camp immediately
they find a rock cliff and princess fiona sleeps alone in a small enclosure on it
shrek tells donkey stories about the stars and then says that things are more than they appear
donkey wonders what they will do when they get back to their swamp but shrek tells him that it's his swamp and he is going to build a tenfoot wall around his land
donkey thinks that shrek is trying to keep people out then shrek shouts at donkey that hes trying to keep everyone out
fiona wakes up and slides the door open then overhears shrek telling donkey how people judge him before they even know him and thats why hes better off alone
fiona closes the door then donkey and shrek talk about the stars again
at his castle lord farquaad is in bed with a drink and repeatedly makes the magic mirror show him the picture of princess fiona
he says that shes perfect
the next morning princess fiona sings with a bird but it explodes when she hit's a high note
she cooks the birds eggs for breakfast
fiona tells shrek and donkey that she is making it up to them because they got off to a bad start yesterday after all they rescued her
as they walk towards duloc shrek burps then fiona burps too
suddenly a man swinging from a vine grabs fiona
he calls out for his merry men
they all appear dancing and singing about him robin hood
as he brandishes a knife robin hood finishes the song by saying he will cut out shreks heart but fiona swings down and knocks him into a boulder
she defeats the merry men with kung fu mixed with the matrix
shrek and donkey are amazed
shrek asks fiona where she learned that and she replies that when one lives alone one has to learn these things
she sees that theres an arrow in shreks butt
donkey starts panicking so fiona sends him off looking for a blue flower with red thorns
when fiona tries to pull out the arrow from shreks butt he squirms falls to the ground and fiona lands on him just as donkey returns with the flower
donkey gets mad because he thinks they just wanted to be alone
when fiona pulls out the arrow donkey sees the blood and faints
shrek picks him up and they head back to duloc
in a field princess fiona grabs a spiders web and gathers up the flying bugs bothering shrek giving it to him who eats it like cotton candy
shrek catches a frog and inflates it like a balloon handing it to fiona
fiona grabs a snake off a tree branch and inflates it like a balloon and gives it to shrek
they push each other playfully then run off together and their balloons float away into the air
they finally reach the windmill and see duloc in the distance
shrek shrugs and tells princess fiona that her future await's her and shes surprised to see duloc
donkey interrupts and tells fiona that shrek thinks lord farquaad is compensating for something
donkey starts to say that it means farquaad has a really
shrek knocks him down a little too hard and then tells fiona that they should move on and starts walking
fiona tells shrek that shes worried about donkey that he dosen't look so good
shrek comes over and plays along with her pretense and says that he looks awful
fiona tells donkey that shell make him some tea
donkey then acts like a hypochondriac
shrek and fiona go to find dinner and firewood
fiona likes the food shrek cooked saying that it's delicious
she sighs then looks at duloc and says that shell be eating differently tomorrow night
he hopes that she will visit him in the swamp because hell cook for her
she says that she would like that and then they smile and look at each other
shrek begins to ask fiona something important but changes his mind and asks for the rest of her food
they lean towards each other about to kiss
donkey butts in saying that the sunset is romantic
fiona jumps up panicking
she pretends to be afraid of the dark and donkey tells her that he is afraid of the dark too
fiona goes into the windmill to sleep by herself glancing back briefly at shrek
donkey tells shrek that he can tell with his animal instincts that shrek and fiona were digging on each other
and says that shrek should tell fiona how he feels about her
shrek tries to deny that he likes her and then dejectedly says that fiona is a princess and he is an ogre
he walks off and tells donkey that hes getting more firewood but donkey sees that theres still a large pile of firewood there
shrek sit's alone by a field of sunflowers staring at duloc until night
donkey afraid to be alone by himself in the dark goes inside the windmill looking for princess fiona
a large green hand grabs the ladder and then a female ogre looks down on donkey as he wanders around
all the sights and sounds frighten donkey
the ogre falls through the wood and screams as she lands on the floor frightening donkey even more
hes terrified when she stands up and he screams for shrek
donkey asks her what she did with the princess
she tries to calm and quiet him down saying that it's her in this body
he thinks that she ate the princess and shouts at her stomach then calls for shrek again
she finally calms him down and convinces him that she is the princess
he wonders what happened to her telling her that shes
she admit's that shes ugly
donkey thinks it's because she ate the weed rat but she tells him that shes been this way as long as she can remember
she says that it only happens when the sun goes down
she looks at her reflection in a barrel of water and recites a spell by night one way by day another
this shall be the norm until you find loves first kiss and then take loves true form
she tells donkey that when she was a little girl a witch cast a spell on her every night she becomes this this horrible ugly beast she was placed in a tower to await the day her true love would rescue her
fiona sit's down and tells donkey that it's why she has to marry farquaad tomorrow before the suns sets and he sees her like this
she cries and then donkey tries to console her
he says that shes ugly but adds that she only looks like this at night and that shrek is ugly all the time
she replies that shes a princess and it's not how a princess should look
donkey suggests that she shouldn't marry farquaad
she insists that she has to because only her true loves first kiss can break the spell
donkey tells her that shes an ogre and shreks an ogre and that they have a lot in common
shrek walks back to the windmill holding a sunflower
hes rehearsing what he will say to princess fiona when he gives it to her
when he climbs the steps of the windmill he overhears fiona telling donkey that she just can't marry whomever she wants and to take a good look at her
she asks donkey who could ever love a beast so hideous and ugly princess and ugly don't go together
thats why i can't stay here with shrek
my only chance to live happily ever after is to marry my true love
she tells donkey that it's just how it should be
shrek becomes disheartened because he thinks fiona was calling him ugly and then throws the sunflower down and storms off towards duloc
fiona tells donkey that it's the only way to break the spell
he tells her that she has to tell shrek the truth and starts to leave but she says that no one must ever know and makes donkey promise not to tell anyone
donkey says that she should tell shrek then goes outside
fiona opens the door and looks around but only sees the sunflower and takes it inside
donkey looks around then sleeps by the campfire
in the morning princess fiona picks off the petals of the sunflower reciting the he loves me he loves me not
game but instead saying i tell him i tell him not
she pulls off the last petal excited that she should tell shrek about her spell
she opens the door and calls for him but only sees donkey outside snoring
the sun rises and she transforms back to human form
shrek walks up and she rushes to greet him but he angrily walks past her and sit's on the steps
she says that she has to tell him something but he replies that he heard everything she said last night
she says that she thought he would understand
he says he understands quoting her asking who could ever love a hideous ugly beast
she says that she thought it wouldn't matter to him but he says that it does
a horse whinnies and they turn around
fanfare announces lord farquaads arrival as he rides towards them accompanied by some knights then donkey wakes up
farquaad greets princess fiona and then shrek demands that farquaad give him the deed to his swamp as promised
farquaad tells shrek that the swamp is cleared out as agreed then tells him to take the deed and go before he changes his mind
shrek grabs the deed and stands aside
farquaad calls fiona beautiful
she tells him that she was just saying a short farewell just as a knight sets him on the ground
farquaad says that it's sweet that she dosen't have to waste good manners on the ogre it dosen't have feelings
fiona agrees that it
farquaad grabs her hand and proposes to her
she looks at shrek who is staring at his deed then accepts
farquaad jumps up happily and tells her that hell make plans for them to marry tomorrow
she stops him and says that they should get married today before the sun sets
shrek angrily walks back to his swamp
farquaad agrees that they should get married today and talks about all the things to prepare
they both get on the horse and head to duloc and then fiona tells shrek faretheewell
donkey tries to stop shrek and says that theres something he dosen't know about fiona
shrek shouts at donkey that he heard what they said last
he tells donkey that since he and fiona are great friends donkey should follow her home
donkey replies that he wants to go with shrek
shrek continues shouting at donkey that he lives alone in his swamp not with anyone else especially useless pathetic annoying talking donkeys
shrek storms off to his swamp
 at his swamp shrek sees that the fairy tale creatures are gone only their tents remain along with some debris
he sighs heavily and walks back to his house
donkey walks through the forest sadly glancing back
shrek sees his reflection in a puddle of water and then sadly lowers his head
princess fiona in her wedding gown looks sadly out the window
shrek looks sadly out his window then angrily takes a sunflower off the table and throws it into the fireplace
fiona sadly looks at herself again in the mirror
farquaad looks at himself in the magic mirror which smiles only when hes looking at it
fiona looks at the wedding cake and pushes the figurine of farquaad down to it's proper height
she turns around and quizzically looks at the suit of armor
at the same spot in his house shrek leans sadly against the table and stares at the fireplace
donkey drinks from a pond by the forest then is startled when he hears and sees the dragon crying they console each other
shrek is alone and tries to eat at his table fiona is alone and tries to eat at her table they both put their faces in their hands
shrek hears a thumping sound outside and opens the door to see donkey putting branches on the ground
donkey tells him that it's a wall
shrek tells him that a wall should go around his swamp
donkey replies that it does go around his half of the swamp and that donkey gets the other half
donkey tells shrek that he earned half of the swamp because he did half of the work rescuing the princess
they argue over ownership of the swamp
shrek gives up and walks away saying that hes done with donkey then donkey chases after him
donkey says that shrek just thinks about himself hes mean to donkey insults him dosen't appreciate him and pushes him around or away
shrek asks donkey that if he treated him so bad why did he come back donkey replies that it's what friends do they forgive each other
shrek agrees and then he shouts that he forgives donkey for stabbing him in the back
shrek goes into the outhouse and slams the door
donkey tells shrek that hes so wrapped up like onion layers in his feelings
shrek tells donkey to go away but he tells shrek that hes doing it again
like he did to fiona all she ever did was love him
shrek replies that he heard their conversation that she called him ugly a hideous creature
donkey tells him that she wasnt talking about him but was talking about somebody else
shrek comes out and asks who she was talking about
donkey refuses to tell him because shrek dosen't listen to him
shrek apologizes and admit's that he is just a big stupid ugly ogre
donkey forgives him because thats what friends are for
shrek wonders what fiona said about him but donkey tells him to ask her
shrek cries out that they won't make the wedding in time
donkey whistles and the dragon flies down
shrek climbs the chain up then the dragon puts donkey up too
they fly away to duloc
at the castle the bishop is marrying princess fiona and lord farquaad
thelonius holds the rings
two men hold up cue cards for the audiences appropriate response
fiona interrupts and asks the bishop to skip to the i dos
farquaad chuckles and tells the bishop to continue
the dragon lands outside and then the knights run away fearfully
shrek goes to the door of the church but donkey tells him to wait until the preacher says speak now or forever hold your peace then for shrek to say i object
shrek says that he dosen't have time for this but donkey replies that chicks like romance
they go to the side of the church and shrek repeatedly throws donkey up to look through a window
donkey tells shrek that they are already married
shrek bursts into the church just before farquaad and fiona kiss shouting that he objects
fiona and farquaad are annoyed to see him
shrek wants to talk to fiona but she says that it's too late and tries to kiss farquaad
shrek grabs her hand and tells her that farquaad only wants to marry her so that he can be king then tells her that farquaad is not her true love
fiona asks him what he knows about true love
shrek stammers and farquaad laughs because shrek loves the princess
farquaad cues the laughter
fiona asks shrek if it's true but farquaad grabs her hand and insists that she kiss him now
fiona looks at the setting sun and recalls her spell
she walks to the window and tells shrek that she wanted to show this to him before
she transforms into an ogre and then grins sheepishly at shrek
as for shrek he can only casually note that her state explains a lot about her recent behaviour
the audience is shocked
farquaad sees fiona and says that it
is disgusting and orders his guards to get it
out of his sight to get them both
as shrek and fiona try to reach each other farquaad declares that the marriage is still binding that he is still king and puts on the crown
as guards drag shrek away farquaad tells that hell beg for death
he then tells fiona that hell lock her back in that tower for the rest of her life
shrek frees one of his hands and whistles
the dragon bursts through the large stained glass window with donkey on top and swallows farquaad killing him then burps out his crown
shrek tells fiona that he loves her and she tells him that he loves him too
they kiss and then fiona begins her transformation as her voiceover recounts the rest of the spell
she rises up into the air glowing
bright light radiates from her then a shock wave from her shatters all the windows in the church except one 
fiona completes her transformation and then returns to the floor and collapses
shrek helps fiona up
shes still an ogre and tells shrek that she dosen't understand that shes supposed to be beautiful
shrek tells her that she is beautiful and they kiss again
at the swamp shrek and fiona get married with donkey and all the fairy tale creatures as guests
the wedding song is im a believer by smash mouth
one of the fairy godmothers transforms the three blind mice into horses and a garlic bulb into a carriage and then shrek and fiona leave in the carriage
donkey takes over the song with the others singing and dancing
the wedding celebration continues while shrek and fiona ride away into the sunset
the fairy tale ends with and they lived ugly ever after
the book closes revealing the fairy tale to be shrek and the song ends

let me get this straight
youre gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a 
princess just so farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only 
don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place
is that about right
maybe theres a good reason donkeys shouldn't talk
i don't get it
why don't you just pull some of that orge stuff on 
him throttle him lay siege to his fortress grinds his bones to make 
your bread the whole orge trip
oh i know what
maybe i could have decapitated an entire village and 
put their heads on a pike gotten a knife cut open their spleen and 
does that sound good to you
uh no not really no
for your information theres a lot more to orges than people think
example okay um orges are like onions
they make you cry
you leave them in the sun they get all brown start sproutin little 
no layers onions have layers
orges have layers onions have 
you get it we both have layers
oh you both have layers
 you know not everybody likes 
cake everybody loves cakes cakes have layers
orges are not like cakes
you know what else everybody likes parfait's
have you ever met a 
person you say lets get some parfait
they say no i don't like 
no parfait parfait's are delicious
no you dense irritating miniature beast of burden orges are like 
onions and of story
parfait's may be the most delicious thing on the whole damn planet
you know i think i preferred your humming
do you have a tissure or 
something im making a mess
just the word parfait make me start 
im on my way from misery to happiness today
im on my way from misery to happiness today
and everything that you receive up yonder
is what you give to me the day i wander
im on my way 
im on my way 
im on my way 
ohh shrek did you do that
you gotta warn somebody before you just crack one off
my mouth was 
believe me donkey if it was me youd be dead
brimstone we must be getting close
don't be talking about it's the brimstone
know what i smell
it wasnt no brimstone
it didn't come off no stone 
sure it's big enough but look at the location
uh shrek uh remember when you said orges have layers
well i have a bit of a confession to make
donkeys don't have 
we wear our fear right out there on our sleeves
donkeys don't have sleeves
you know what i mean
you can't tell me youre afraid of heights
im just a little uncomfortable about being on a rickety bridge over 
a boiling like of lava
im right here beside ya okay for emotional 
support well just tackle this thing together one little baby step 
okay that makes me feel so much better
and don't look down
okay don't look down
shrek im lookin down oh god i can't do this just let me off 
but youre already halfway
but i know that half is safe
i don't have time for this
just donkey lets have a dance then shall me
yes yes do it
no shrek no stop it
you said do it im doin it
shrek im gonna die
so where is this firebreathing painintheneck anyway
inside waiting for us to rescue her
i was talkin about the dragon shrek
cause theres nothin wrong with bein afraid
fears a sensible 
response to an unfamiliar situation
unfamiliar dangerous situation i 
with a dragon that breathes fire and eats knights and 
breathes fire it sure dosen't mean youre a coward if youre a little 
i sure as heck aint no coward
donkey two things okay shut 
now go over there and see if 
you can find any stairs
stairs i thought we was lookin for the princess
the princess will be up the stairs in the highest room in the tallest 
what makes you think shell be there
i read it in a book once
you handle the dragon
i'll handle the stairs
i'll find those 
i'll whip their butt too
those stairs won't know which way 
im gonna take drastic steps
kick it to the curb
don't mess with 
im the stair master
ive mastered the stairs
i wish i had a 
id step all over it
well at least we know where the princess is but wheres the 
oh what large teeth you have
i mean white sparkling teeth
i know you probably hear this all time 
from your food but you must bleach cause that is one dazzling smile 
do i detect a hint of minty freshness and you know 
what else youre youre a girl dragon oh sure i mean of 
course youre a girl dragon
youre just reeking of feminine beauty
whats the matter with you you got something in your eye ohh
man id really love to stay but you know im uh 
im an asthmatic and i don't know if itd work out if youre gonna 
no shrek shrek shrek
are you princess fiona
i am awaiting a knight so bold as to rescue me
but wait sir knight
this beith our first meeting
should it not be 
a wonderful romantic moment
what are you doing you should sweep me off my feet out 
yonder window and down a rope onto your valiant steed
youve had a lot of time to plan this havent you
but we have to savor this moment you could recite an epic poem for 
a ballad a sonnet a limerick or something
i don't think so
can i at least know the name of my champion
i pray that you take this favor as a token of my gratitude
you didn't slay the dragon
it's on my todo list
but this isnt right you were meant to charge in sword drawn 
thats what all the other knights did
yeah right before they burst into flame
thats not the point
where are you going the nexts over there
well i have to save my ass
what kind of knight are you
one of a kind
slow down baby please
i believe it's healthy to get to 
know someone over a long perriod of time
just call me oldfashioned
i don't want to rush into a physical relationship
emotionally ready for a commitment of uh this magnitude really 
is the word im looking for
magnitude hey that is unwanted 
hey what are you doing okay okay
lets just back 
up a little and take this one step at a time
we really should get to 
know each other first as friends or pen pals
im on the road a lot 
but i just love receiving cards id really love to stay but 
don't do that thats my tail thats my personal tail
i don't give permission what are you gonna do with 
no no no no no
yeah it's getting him to shut up thats the trick
okay you two heard for the exit i'll take care of the dragon
you rescued me youre amazing
a little unorthodox i'll admit
but they deed is great and 
thine heart is pure
i am eternally in your debt
and where would a brave knight be without his noble steed
i hope you heard that
she called me a noble steed
she think im a 
the battle is won
you may remove your helmet good sir knight
i have helmet hair
i wouldst look upon the face of my rescuer
no no you wouldn't st
but how will you kiss me
what that wasnt in the job description
maybe it's a perk
oh you must know how it goes
a princess locked in 
a tower and beset by a dragon is rescued by a brave knight and then 
they share true loves first kiss
hmm with shrek you think wait
you think that shrek is you 
you think shrek is your true love
what is so funny
lets just say im not your tipe okay
of course you are
now now remove your 
i really don't think this is a good idea
just take off the helmet
im not going to
you youre a an orge
oh you were expecting prince charming
this is all wrong
youre not supposed 
to be an orge
princess i was sent to rescue you by lord farquaad okay he is the 
one who wants to marry you
then why didn't he come rescue me
you should ask him that when we get there
but i have to be rescued by my true love not by some prge and his 
so much for noble steed
youre not making my job any easier
im sorry but your job is not my problem
you can tell lord farquaad 
that if he wants to rescue me properly i'll be waiting for him right 
hey im no ones messenger boy all right im a delivery boy
im right behind ya
put me down or you will suffer the consequences this is not 
dignified put me down
okay so heres another question
say theres a woman that digs you 
right but you don't really like her that way
how do you let her down 
real easy so her feelings aren't hurt but you don't get burned to a 
you just tell her shes not your true love
everyone knowest what 
happens when you find your hey
the sooner we get to duloc the better
youre gonna love it there princess
and what of my groomtobe lord farquaad whats he like
let me put it this way princess
men of farquaads stature are in 
there are those who think little of him
stop it both of you
youre just jealous you can never 
measure up to a great ruler like lord farquaad
yeah well maybe youre right princess
but i'll let you do the 
when you see him tomorrow
tomorrow itll take that long shouldn't we stop to make camp
no thatll take longer
we can keep going
but theres robbers in the woods
whoa time out shrek campings starting to sound good
im scarier than anything were going to see in this 
i need to find somewhere to camp now
shrek we can do better than that
i don't think this is fit for a 
no no it's perfect
it just needs a few homey touches
homey touches like what
a door well gentlemen i bid thee good night
you want me to read you a bedtime story i will
i said good night
shrek what are you doing
i just you know oh come on
i was just kidding
and uh that one thats throwback the only orge to ever spit over 
hey can you tell my future from these stars
the stars don't tell the future donkey

it's the only 
way to break the spell

the minor fall the major lift
the baffled king composing hallelujah
baby ive been here before
i know this room ive walked this floor
i used to live alone before i knew you
ive seen your flag on the marble arch
but love is not a victory march
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah
and all i ever learned from love
is how to shoot at someone
and it's not a cry you can hear at night
it's not somebody whos seen the light
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah
what are you doing
i would think of all people you would recognize a wall when you see 
but the walls supposed to go around my swamp not 
it is around your half
