back in the house daki screams at tengen for cutting her head off and he responds by telling her to die quietly
the enraged demon reminds him that he had denied her upper rank status which he affirms but she proceeds to insist her status much to his annoyance
emerging from her body dakis brother confronts tengen
to the hashiras astonishment daki begins to throw a tantrum and cry and he notes that she has been talking for far too long when she should have showed signs of dying
still throwing her tantrum daki calls out to gyutaro
to save her and a male demon begins to emerge from her body
tengen senses the danger and attempts to immediately attack the two but his blades hit nothing but air as the demons disappear from his sight
on the other side of the room behind tengen gyutaro comforts daki asking that she at least try to reattach her own head
tengen wonders why daki is still alive after being beheaded as well as the presence of the new demon who he comments as having great reaction speed
gyutaro tells daki to heal her burn complimenting her good looks and wounds tengen when he attempts to attack them again
gyutaro compliments tengens attempt to attack him as well as his success at blocking his attack
he reveals that he was intending to kill tengen with that attack and eerily prepares to him on in a battle
within the entertainment district there are men known as gyus
or barkers who work to attract customers to enter the brothels
gyutaro worked as one of these men and eventually named himself using the word gyu
inside one of the brothels gyutaro and tengen are about to engage in combat but before they do so gyutaro begins to analyze tengens appearance
he comments about his nice face good skin and height mentioning that he must attract a lot of attention from women
gyutaro begins to eerily scratch at his face until he begins to bleed and voices his jealousy over tengens looks
in the corner of the room daki can be seen crying as she whines at gyutaro to kill the other demon slayers who burned her as well
she proceeds to tell him that they ganged
up on her and she tried her hardest to kill her causing gyutaro to seethe with anger
using two large sickles he creates a flurry of large arclike slashes aiming them towards tengen
elsewhere in the district tanjiro can be seen carrying nezuko as he rushes to put her away to safety
he looks up into the sky and sees the sickles return back in the direction that they came like a boomerang he becomes concerned when he smells tengens blood and rushes to return to help
at that moment inosuke and zenit'su can be seen prancing towards him as they comically announce their arrival
tanjiro quickly informs them to help tengen and inosuke reassures him that hes going to be reeeeal
flashy before pardoning tanjiro to put nezuko in her box
gyutaro using his blood demon art
back at the brothel gyutaro seethes with jealousy after witnessing how cool
tengen looks by protecting the bystanders within the home causing him to brag about his appearance and marriage to three women
gyutaro pauses in astonishment before furiously scratching his face after hearing of tengens polygamy he proceeds to use his blood demon art flying blood sickles to try to kill the hashira but tengen manages to block it
a large explosion causes the floor beneath tengen to give in and he manages to escape by dropping down one floor however gyutaro commands his sickles to turn and they come straight for tengen yet again
daki and gyutaro fighting together
daki fights alongside gyutaro
by this point tengen has realized gyutaros ability to change the sickles direction and tries to formulate a plan on how to defeat the siblings
he therorizes that in order to kill the demons he would need to cut off gyutaros head instead of dakis and he tries to test it out
tengen grabs 3 small balls and throws them into the air he proceeds to aim for them and precisely hit's them to cause an explosion within the brothel
as the brothel begins to crumble tengen is seen standing on the rubble as he admit's it won't be easy to defeat the demons
he looks at the large obi ball before him and the siblings emerge unscathed as they confidently proclaim that they fight as one
after successfully finding the box and returning nezuko inside tanjiro quickly tries to return to the battlefield in order to assist tengen uzui
tengen grows angry with the demons
tengen becomes fed up with gyutaros comments
back at the battlefield gyutaro scowls as he mentions tengens supreme abilities calling him different and talented compared to the other hashira hes killed
his comments somewhat irritate tengen and he berates him for thinking that hes talented compared to other people on the planet calling him ignorant
he grows more and more angry as he recalls the people hes lost over the years despite being called the supposed chosen
after listening to him speak gyutaro grows irritated at the fact that he has not died yet revealing that his poison drenched sickles should have killed him
tengen explains that he has built a resistance to poison as he was raised in a shinobi household with nine siblings but by the age of fifteen seven of them had already died
his father was a cold and heartless individual who would regularly forced them to undergo intense training and as a result his brother adopted the same ruthless and cold hearted personality
unable to understand that type of mindset tengen left his clan alongside his wives and approached kagaya ubuyashiki to become members of the corps
kagaya had warned them it would be hard to reject the values they were raised in but openly welcomed and thanked tengens family for deciding to put their lives at risk to protect others
tengen attacks daki and gyutaro
tengen attacks the siblings
in the present gyutaro notices the deterioration in tengens physical state and becomes gleeful when he realizes that his poison is slowly taking effect
tengen proceeds to refute his claim saying that he is still in pristine condition and charges forward to attack the siblings
as they engage in a battle tengen manages to kick daki away from gyutaro and releases numerous dark beads which cause a cluster of explosions
by setting a distraction tengen attempts to decapitate gyutaro while only hold the tip of one end of his blades but it is promptly blocked by the demon
as both sides reassess the situation daki is left whining as she pathetically reattaches her head to her body once again
gyutaro confronts tengen about discovering the method on how to defeat them but he feigns his innocence pretending not to notice
inosuke and zenit'su arrive to help tengen
zenit'su and inosuke arrive to assist in the battle
despite tengens discovery gyutaro cockingly says that despite knowing their weakness tengen will still die from the poisoning since the demons have the advantage in the battle
at that moment zenit'su and inosuke arrive to question the validity of gyutaros claim that theyre going to win
the two boys flamboyantly announce their arrival to the fight which confuses everyone at the moment but then tanjiro drops down from the ceiling above them and stands between the injured tengen and the demons preparing to fight
makio and suma can be seen frantically trying trying to evacuate the citizens of the district as the battle resumes against the demons
gyutaro tries to discourage and the three new arrivals and manages to intimidate tanjiro however tengen uzui comes up behind them and proudly announces that theyre going to win
as daki finishes reattaching her head she loudly doubts his words by saying that they can't win since the hashira has been poisoned
tanjiro envisions kyojuro when tengen speaks
unfazed tengen once again proudly announces their intent to win and speaks highly of the three boys
looking back at him tanjiro sees the persona of kyojuro rengoku emitting from tengen as he speaks which excites inosuke
gyutaro nearly striking tanjiro
gyutaro and daki get riled up and reveal that theyve eaten 15 and 7 hashira respectively and begin to attack the group
as daki attempts to attack tengen and tanjiro from behind zenit'su bursts through the home within seconds to block the attack as inosuke follows him
now on the rooftop daki finally recognizes zenit'su from the kyogoku house and he demandingly commands her to apologize to the girl whom he had found crying earlier
she mocks his speech by revealing that women are treated like merchandise within the district and as the orian she was allowed to do as she pleased with other people since she was the main breadwinner of the house
when she looks up at zenit'su a third eye appears on dakis forehead revealing that gyutaro can see them via her new eye
inosuke and zenit'su face daki
zenit'su and inosuke face daki
back in the brothel tanjiro becomes intimidated by gyutaros evil aura but formulates a plan to counter his attacks and protect tengen
however the demon manages to rush towards tanjiro within an instant and catch him off guard narrowly piercing him through his jaw
before he can do so tengen grabs tanjiro by the nape of his clothes and throws him to safety before engaging in battle with gyutaro
as he crash lands and looks back to see the two fighting tanjiro senses an ominous object approaching them from above and dakis obi can be seen crashing down all around them
on the rooftop daki can be heard cackling as she admit's she is now displaying her full strength since gyutaro is awake and allowing her to used his enhanced senses
zenit'su and inosuke can be seen covered in cuts and wounds as they prepare to engage with daki in battle
the chapter concludes with gyutaro disregarding tengens claims of the boys being tsuguko undermining their capabilities as swordsmen
the demon slayers can be seen engaging in battle with the two demons of the entertainment district fighting ferociously on the rooftop and inside one of the brothels
as the building begins to collapse tengen uzui finds himself getting cornered between two of gyutaros attacks however tanjiro jumps in and manages to protect him from the slashes
tengen proceeds to use sound breathing fifth form string performance to try to corner gyutaro but dakis obi interferes and protects her brother from the attacks
hinatsuru using her kunai box
tengen begins to be pushed back by the obi however tanjiro moves in to cut the obi and tries to distract gyutaro
the hashira is left amazed at tanjiros endurance despite suffering a serious shoulder wound and realizes that tanjiro had tied his sword to his hand to prevent him from dropping it due to exhaustion
meanwhile on the rooftop inosuke and zenit'su can be seen struggling as they try to evade the attacks from dakis obi
the boys realize that daki is know attacking them with the blood blades used by gyutaro making it impossible for them to approach her
now that the brothel has been destroyed tengen and tanjiro are left to fight gyutaro and the obi beneath the night sky
on a nearby rooftop hinatsuru appears carrying a large box filled with kunai darts and proceeds to launch dozens of them down below onto gyutaro
at first he is left confused behind the random attack but then gyutaro utilizes his blood demon art rampant arc rampage to deflect them away from him
gyutaro using his blood demon art
gyutaro is left shocked when tengen proceeds to attack him despite getting pierced with the darts
he attempts to decapitate him with his sickle however tengen manages to evade his attack and successfully cut off his legs
at that moment gyutaro is struck on the neck by one of the kunai darts and fails to regenerate his feet realizing that the darts were coated with wisteria extract
as his body begins to go numb tanjiro closes in on him to try to decapitate gyutaro leaving him seething with curiosity as the demon slayers quickly gain the upper hand
the kunai darts which were utilized by hinatsuru were revealed to be coated in a poison which would generally paralyze a demon for half a day or possibly immobilize a lower rank
she can be seen on a nearby rooftop pleading for the poison to work for even just a moment as the demon slayers attempt to decapitate gyutaro
however at that moment gyutaro manages to regenerate his legs and proceeds to attack them at a close vicinity
rotating circular slashes flying blood scythes
gyutaro uses his blood demon art
he uses his blood demon art rotating circular slashes flying blood scythes to emit numerous blood slashes to attack them
before they can reach him tengen uzui grabs hold of tanjiro and throws him back to protect him from the attack
within seconds tengen uses sound breathing fourth form constant resounding slashes to deflect gyutaros attack but finds that he has disappeared from sight
to his horror he looks up to the roof only to see that gyutaro has managed to capture hinatsuru and is about to kill her
tanjiro saves hinatsuru from gyutaro
tengen tries to save her however dakis obi blocks him from reaching her
he thinks back to a moment in the past when hinatsuru had asked to retire from the corps following their mission specifically remembering her asking to not harbor any regrets if any of them were to die
back in the present tengen yells at gyutaro to stop as he tries to push through
tanjiro comes close to the building and tries to use the hinokami kagura to reach her however his body refuses to listen to him
tanjiro quickly changes tactics and uses a form of the water breathing to quickly save hinatsuru from gyutaro
realizing that he managed to save hinatsuru tanjiro decides to utilize both the water breathing as well as the hinokami kagura in order to increase his attacking power
gyutaro is left surprised by tanjiros unexpected maneuver and charges at him
however at that moment tengen comes behind gyutaro and swings his blade at gyutaros neck while openly yelling that he owes tanjiro
on a nearby rooftop inosuke can see tengen move in as he attempts to cut off gyutaros head
his frustration grows as they continue to evade dakis attacks instead of move in to try to decapitate her
zenit'su calls out to inosuke and explains that in order to defeat them they just need to make sure their heads aren't connected instead of trying to decapitate the two simultaneously
inosuke comically looks at zenit'su amazed and calls him awesome after seeing the difference in his personality compared to his usual demeanor
gyutaro catches tengens blade
gyutaro catches tengens blade in his mouth
meanwhile tanjiro assists tengen by also trying to swing his blade down onto gyutaros neck however the demon manages to use his sickles to halt both of their attacks and attempts to absorb their blades
tengen uses his free arm to use his second blade to pierce the gyutaro but his quick reflexes allow him to catch the tip of the blade in his mouth
sensing that gyutaro is about to unleash more blood blades tengen tells tanjiro to hang in there as hinatsuru yanks tanjiro away from them allowing tengen to leap off of the roof while pulling the demon with him
before he can leap down to help them a voice can be heard telling them to watch out as inosuke and zenit'su crash onto the roof while fighting the obi
inosuke and zenit'su ask tanjiro for help in order to defeat daki and agrees asking that they finish quickly in order to help tengen
hinatsuru tells the boys that she will hide quickly in order to allow them to focus on the battle and disappears as they face daki
thunderclap and flash eightfold
inosuke tanjiro and zenit'su attacking daki
she gets excited when tanjiro joins their fight and informs his comrades that they need a fast attack in order to cut her neck
inosuke realizes that she has slowed down and decides to go first to attack as zenit'su agrees with tanjiro to protect him from behind
inosuke proceeds to dash forward using beast breathing eighth fang explosive rush while zenit'su and tanjiro use thunder breathing first form thunderclap and flash eightfold and water breathing third form flowing dance respectively to protect inosuke from the obi
daki begins to crack under the pressure as inosuke close in on her and manages to draw both of his blades on either side of her neck
inosuke buries his heels into the ground as he uses beast breathing sixth fang palisade bite to effectively decapitate daki
tanjiro smiles with joy as he witnesses inosuke leap and catch dakis head in the air rejoicing at successfully cutting off her head
inosuke claims they have to act fast and keep her head separated from her body
having successfully decapitated daki inosuke can be seen escaping with her head in order to prevent her from reattaching it to her body
he tells the other boys not to worry about him and to instead help tengen but before he can get to safety daki uses her hair to put up a resistance
gyutaro stabs inosuke to rescue his sister
he manages to put a stop to her resistance but before he can get away gyutaro appears behind him and impales him through the chest
tanjiro looks on in horror as gyutaro grabs dakis head while inosuke collapses on the roof he then looks down on the ground and is once again horrified to see tengen laying bleeding and unresponsive on the ground
zenit'su tries to warn tanjiro of the oncoming obi attack but before he can escape the roof collapses from beneath him and tanjiro falls to the ground seemingly buried beneath the rubble
as he falls unconscious he apologizes to everyone and specifically to nezuko for losing the battle
nezuko appears in tanjiros dream
nezuko appears while tanjiro is unconscious
in his dream nezuko can be seen telling him to stop apologizing for any faults in their lives or for feeling unworthy
she reassures him that it isnt his fault that their lives were ruined and tells him theyll work together to make a better future for themselves
nezuko begins to cry as her body morphs from her human form to her demon form and she pleads for him to never apologize for any regrets and tells him she understands how he feels
tanjiro awakens from his dream and tries to recollect his thoughts but before he gets up gyutaro can be seen standing over him questioning if hes still alive
gyutaro takes it upon himself to tell tanjiro that inosuke was pierced through the heart zenit'su was suffering and trapped beneath the rubble and tengens heart had stopped due to the poison
he proceeds to refer to all of them as pathetic and asks tanjiro how the demon in the box is related to him and he responds by saying shes his younger sister
gyutaro begins to laugh at tanjiros pathetic attempt to protect his sister and tells him he should be using his hands before proceeding to break his fingers
tanjiro makes a final effort to escape
as tanjiro withers on the ground in pain gyutaro proceeds to berate him for his weakness and pulls him by the hair
he teases tanjiro and tells him to try to decapitate him but instead of attacking him he slaps his hand on a small bag and hangs his head down in defeat
believing that he broke tanjiros fighting spirit he reveals his grand idea of offering tanjiro the opportunity to become a demon for the sake of his sister
tanjiro suddenly looks up into the sky and gyutaro asks him if hes trying to hold back his tears but to his surprise tanjiro responds that he had been preparing for the moment
with his face gets close to gyutaros tanjiro brings his head down and headbutts him with a great force momentarily stunning him
daki screams at him to get up but as his legs falter and looks down to discover that a kunai dart has been lodged into his leg
he realizes that when tanjiro had looked down he opened a bag given to him by hinatsuru which contained wisteria poison
tanjiro manages to stand up while gyutaro remains paralyzed and crouched before him and uses his remaining strength to swing the blade down onto his neck
having regained his footing and subdued gyutaro tanjiro manages to draw his blade onto gyutaros neck and press down to try to decapitate him
as he try to forces the blade down tanjiro envisions himself in gyutaros place and thinks that if he were in his situation he would want his comrades to kill him before he could live as a demon
zenit'su gets out of the wreckage ch93
zenit'su escapes from the wreckage
on a nearby rooftop daki can be seen rushing to her feet at the sudden change of events to try to help her brother but before she can get close to them zenit'su manages to free himself from the rubble
he attacks her by using thunder breathing first form thunderclap and flash to bring her attention to him and then uses godspeed to quickly attack her neck
zenit'su pleads with his blade to cut through her neck since he was given the chance to escape the rubble and attack her while gyutaro was subdued

tanjiro continues to struggle to try to cut through gyutaros neck but before he can do so gyutaro manages to emit his blood blades to repel his sword
tanjiro is knocked off balance as gyutaro regains his footing causing them to reengage in battle
gyutaro gains the upper hand and brings his sickle down onto tanjiros neck however at that moment tengen regains his consciousness and protects him from the sickle
despite being severely poisoned and missing his left hand tengen engages in head to head combat with gyutaro while remarking that hes perfected the musical score technique
it is revealed that his technique allows him to analyze maneuvers of his opponents and read them like notes on a piece of sheet music
however the poison has hindered his attacking ability meaning that he can only defend gyutaros attacks
tanjiro gets stabbed through the jaw
tanjiro gets stabbed through the jaw
gyutaro manages to land a powerful attack to the left side of tengens face resulting in the loss of his left eye and proceeds to stab tengen
tanjiro yells out to tengen after witnessing him get stabbed but tengen orders him to ignore him and jump
tanjiro leaps into the air towards gyutaro and attempts to decapitate him but is seemingly stabbed through the jaw by gyutaros sickle
the demon begins to panic as they gain the upper hand and pulsate his poison to try to kill tanjiro however he proceeds to endure the pain and swings his blade towards gyutaro
at the beginning of the chapter it is revealed that the demon siblings were able to keep the demon slayers at bay through a hidden ability
during the battle gyutaro was controlling his sister and was able to see through her point of view giving them the advantage
his poison also affected the demon slayers greatly but there was always a member of the team that would slip through allowing them to continue the fight

tanjiro can be seen swinging his blade down onto gyutaros neck despite the demons sickle piercing through his jaw
his arm strength isnt enough to slice through his neck so he resorts to forcing his entire body to push through ignoring the pain
gyutaro notices the change in tanjiros scar as he develops a demon slayer mark and his eyes roll back in his head
the change in his demeanor proves to be too great as tanjiros blade cuts through gyutaros neck causing him to panic

meanwhile daki can be seen resisting zenit'sus attempt to decapitate her
she attempts to use her obi to kill zenit'su at close range but inosuke unexpectedly rushes up revealing that he protected his heart from being stabbed by rearranging his organs
he also reveals that poison has no effect on him since he was raised on the mountains before proceeding to assist zenit'su in decapitating daki
the three boys let out a roar as they muster out the strength to slice through the demons necks
after the long battle zenit'su and inosuke manage to decapitate daki up on the rooftop while tanjiro can be seen decapitating gyutaro simultaneously on the ground
their heads fall onto the ground and roll around until they end up face to face
tanjiro beheading gyutaro ch94
the demon heads are decapitated
as gyutaros body falls onto the ground tengen notices something being emitted from it and becomes alarmed
meanwhile up on a nearby rooftop suma hinatsuru and makio have arrived to witness the end of the battle
as makio begins to bicker with suma over her behavior hinatsuru notices something is amiss down on the battlefield
she looks down to see tanjiro struggling to breathe as he bleeds out from his jaw while trying to slow down the poison
tanjiro looks over at tengen whos sitting down in front of him and yelling at him with a panicked expression
however tanjiro fails to comprehend his sudden alarm as tengen looks at him with horror
underneath the night sky nezuko can be seen looking down at her brother with a concerned expression
as tanjiro begins to regain consciousness he looks around to see the destroyed buildings around him
nezuko nudges her brother as a way of letting him know that she was the one who saved him from the destruction
tanjiro attempts to get up to search for the others but his legs give out from beneath him and he collapses onto the ground
he hears someone calling out to him in the distance and recognizes the voice as belonging to zenit'su and is unexpectedly picked up and carried by nezuko
the pair move towards the source of the commotion and discover zenit'su has awakened from his slumber not remembering any of the events that had transpired
he tells tanjiro that he can hear inosukes heartbeat get weaker and weaker and points to him laying unconscious nearby
nezuko heals inosuke by setting him on fire
the siblings rush over to him and tanjiro attempts to wake inosuke up but to his dismay he feels his heart get weaker
tanjiro begins to panic and thinks of exposing him to sunlight or sending a crow to shinobu for help but realizes he dosen't have time for either of the options
his tears begin to well up as inosuke lays dying before him but nezuko comes forward and unexpectedly sets inosuke on fire
tanjiro looks on amazed as he witnesses inosukes poisoned skin heal right before his eyes and his comrade suddenly awakens to announce hes hungry
the three rejoice at the fact that hes okay and embrace as tanjiro begins to sob
elsewhere on the battlefield suma begins to wail loudly while pleading for tengen to live after winning the battle
her cowife makio begins to panic as she realizes the antidote they administered is not working to remove the poison from his body and hinatsuru begins to weep
realizing that he dosen't have much time left to live tengen begins to relay his final words to his wives but is interrupted by sumas loud wails
makio becomes enraged at sumas overreactive cries and begins to pull her by the hair and shove rocks into her mouth to make her be quiet while hinatsuru tries to prevent them from bickering
in a comical fashion tengen sit's spectating as his wives continue to bicker while his final moments slip away he then realizes that he can no longer move his speak due to the poison
nezuko setting tengen on fire
nezuko sets tengen on fire
everyone momentarily pauses when nezuko suddenly appears next to tengen they proceed to stare at her as she raises her hand and grabs his arm before setting him on fire
his wives look on in horror until suma comically pulls nezuko away saying that it's too soon to cremate him
to their surprise tengen begins to speak again and asks how it's possible that the poison has been removed from his body bringing relief to his wives
tanjiro subtly explains that nezukos blood demon art has somehow managed to remove the poison from their bodies and expresses his relief to know that tengen is safe
tengen tries to tell tanjiro to rest if not he will die from his injuries but he informs tengen that he needs to confirm that the demons have been defeated before he can rest
gyutaro arguing with daki
the demon siblings begin to argue as they disintegrate
the siblings proceed throughout the rubble in search of the demons heads and come across a pool of demon blood
tanjiro pulls out an apparatus and decides to collect the blood in order to be studied
once the blood has been collected tamayos cat familiar chachamaru appears before tanjiro and he puts it in the box to be delivered to tamayo
as the siblings continue their search tanjiro smells the scent of the demons and guides nezuko to head towards them
when they arrive gyutaro and daki can be seen viciously arguing over their defeat
their heads begin to disintegrate as they blame each other for losing the battle with gyutaro degrading daki for being useless
daki retaliates by saying that someone as ugly as gyutaro cannot be considered her relative which leaves tanjiro looking at them concerned about the hurtful words they are spewing at each other
daki and gyutaro continue arguing as their heads begin to disintegrate she starts chastising her brother for being useless and questions if theyre even related
gyutaro grows angry at her comments and calls her a weakling even regretting protecting her in the first place
he loses his temper and goes on to spew hateful remarks such as mentioning that his life wouldve been better without her and wishing that she had never been born causing dakis eyes to well up with tears
tanjiro intervenes and covers gyutaros mouth stating that he dosen't mean what hes saying and that they shouldn't spend their final moments fighting with each other
daki begins to wail at tanjiro out of frustration yelling at him to leave them alone and stop lecturing them
dakis head reaches it's last phases of disintegration and she cries out for her brother to save her saying that she dosen't want to die
gyutaro hopelessly watches as her head dissolves away while still calling out him before he impulsively calls out to her by her birth name ume
as he reaches his final moments gyutaro recalls his past as a human born in the kirimise to a prostitute mother
before she died from syphilis his mother tried to kill him many times even after his younger sister was born
due to his appearance his voice and lack of hygiene the young gyutaro was bullied and detested by everyone he met
things began to change after his sister was born as her beauty dismissed his inferiority complex and he used his ugliness plus his newfound fighting skills to become an efficient debt collector
gyutaro returns from a job only to find his sister horribly burned due to the actions of a vengeful samurai
however the good fortune would not last for the siblings
when ume turned 13 she blinded a samurai with a comb and was subsequently burned alive for her crime
having been away on his job at the time gyutaro returned to find her barely alive and hugged her as she clinged to life
he cursed the gods to return his sister and for treating them cruelly before he is attacked by the same samurai
the samurai slashes gyutaro from behind allowing him to bleed out at he chats with one of the brothel managers
the manager brazingly calls gyutaro a nuisance and a brute for harassing the locals of the district before expressing her pity at having lost ume as a courtesan
before the samurai could finish him off gyutaro viciously kills the manager and berates the samurai for having a lavish lifestyle before gruesomely killing him as well by snapping his katana and slicing his head in half with his sickle
as gyutaro tried to find help for him and his sister no one would help them due to their reputation and circumstances
he trudges on through the street until he ultimately collapses and bleeds out on the floor as snow begins to fall
the siblings lay on the floor dying until they are discovered by one of the upper ranks who offers to turn them into demons
gyutaro adamantly proclaims that he would become a demon again no matter how many times he is reborn wanting to always bring fear as gyutaro the debt collector
gyutaro muses how daki could have been if he had raised her differently before taking note of his surroundings
a younger looking daki appeared behind him disgusted with their current location and wondering where the exit was
the emaciated man ordered her not to follow him anymore getting angry when she wouldn't comply
a tearful daki apologized for her earlier cruel insults stating that it was because she had not wanted to accept that it was her fault that they had lost
when gyutaro still refused to let her come with him daki tackled him from behind stubbornly refusing to ever let go vowing to always be his little sister no matter how often they are reborn and reminding him of the promise they had made long ago to always stay together
finally accepting her company gyutaro carries his sister into the fire that await's them
hearing the news about the defeat of one of the upper ranks kagaya is determined to see muzan defeated in his generation
in the world of the living tanjiro and nezuko watch as the last of the demon siblings dissolves into the air
tanjiro wonders if they made up which nezuko affirms
elsewhere obanai iguro attempts to praise tengen for his defeat of upper rank 6 but is disappointed that he beat such a low ranking member of the twelve kizuki as well as lost his left arm and eye
tengen states his intention to retire as a hashira but obanai refuses to accept this as there is already a vacan't hashira position and the lower ranks of the demon slayer corps keep on dying without improving
tengen disagrees with this last point stating that tanjiro is definitely improving while obanai is surprised he survived the fight
elsewhere kagaya ubuyashiki learns of the groups victory and is elated but is stricken by complications from his illness
he states that this victory will have massive consequences enough to ensure muzan kibutsujis defeat within their generation and then collapses into a bout of coughing
at the infinity castle akaza ponders how his summoning must mean a member of the upper ranks has been defeated
akaza looks on with displeasure as the biwa demon plays her instrument and is greeted by one of his upper rank colleagues gyokko
the potted demon asks him how hes been after ninety years and proclaims his insincere worry over akaza being the slain upper rank
hantengu corrects his colleague as it had actually been one hundred and thirteen years since they had last been summoned and expresses his concern over the oddity and unluckiness of the number
ignoring them akaza asks the biwa demon if muzan had arrived the answer being no and then asks if upper rank 1 had arrived
before she can answer doma places a hand on akazas shoulder asking him to show some concern for his wellbeing as he did not wish to see any of his precious buddies
gyokko and doma exchange small talk about the formers pot and latters use of the pot that gyokko had given him
akaza demands that doma remove his hand viciously punching him when he dosen't immediately do so
quickly recovering from the blow doma pleasantly asks if akaza had gotten stronger since they last met enraging the tattooed demon
the biwa demon finally relates that upper rank 1 had been the first to arrive surprising akaza who quickly spotted his silent colleague
kokushibo noted that he was present as was their master
as each upper rank reacted to the silent arrival of their leader muzan noted that gyutaro was dead
