tanjiros attack completely severs enmus neck causing the lower rank to unleash a terrible scream and break into pieces
the piece of the demonic train that tanjiro and inosuke are on begins to fall sideways with the formers earlier wound from the train engineer suddenly flaring with pain
inosuke notes this with concern but tanjiro tells him to protect the passengers his only concern living so that the train engineer dosen't become a murderer
the young demon slayer is cast a short distance from the inevitable train wreck with inosuke immediately attending to him
tanjiro asks inosuke to help the trapped and badly injured engineer and after a mild argument the latter agrees to do so
tanjiro then attempts to stabilize his breathing wanting to go help the injured passengersa short distance away what remains of enmu notes with disbelief his bodys continued disintegration his lack of regeneration and his entire schemes failure
something lands next to tanjiro and kyojuro
he further notes the interference of kyojuro zenit'su and nezuko with frustration but expresses the most anger towards tanjiro and inosuke attempting to maneuver his crumbling body towards them
this ultimately failing the lower rank laments his inability to ascend to the rank of upper rank desperately wanting a redo as he finally expires
kyojuro compliments tanjiro on being able to constantly perform total concentration breathing stating that he is one step closer to becoming a hashira
he then notes the youths injury a collapsed blood vessel and instructs him on how to stop the bleeding
tanjiro puts all of his focus on stopping the hemorrhage with support from his superior and eventually succeeds
kyojuro explains that if he masters his breathing he will be able to do a multitude of things and also informs the youth that all the passengers are safe
without warning something lands near the two causing a large explosion
the dust settles to reveal a tattooed demon who tanjiro quickly realizes is upper rank three of the twelve kizuki
the powerful foe swiftly attacks the prone demon slayer but kyojuro defends the youth and slices the offenders arm in twain with the flame breathing second form rising scorching sun
the demon retreats a short distance the damaged arm quickly regenerating and compliments kyojuros blade
akaza asks kyojuro to become a demon
the upper rank proposes kyojuro become a demon
kyojuro states he cannot understand why the demon would attack a wounded person the answer to which is that they would simply get in the pairs way
kyojuro dismisses this stating that despite this being their first meeting he already hates the upper rank a sentiment the demon shares with weak humans
kyojuro notes their different moral values to which the upper rank offers a proposal become a demon like him
the prominent demon hunter quickly declined this but the upper rank complimented his strength nevertheless deducing him to be a hashira
kyojuro introduces himself as the flame hashira while the upper rank reveals his name to be akaza
he goes on to say that kyojuro will never cross into supreme territory
because he is human destined to grow old and die and again proposes he become a demon
tanjiro notes that akaza smells similarly to muzan kibutsuji and desperately searches for his sword to help kyojuro
the hashira explains that growing old and dying is the fleeting beauty of humanity and that their strength dosen't lie in the body
he states that tanjiro isnt weak and shouldn't be insulted repeats his earlier observation of their different moral values and firmly declares that he will never become a demon
akaza readies an attack
akaza unleashes his technique development destructive death compass needle as he readies his fighting stance declaring his intent to kill kyojuro for his refusal and the two clash
as kyojuro uses the flame breathing first form unknowing fire tanjiro is unable to follow their fight with his eyes while elsewhere inosuke senses the conflict
akaza informs kyojuro that all of the hashira he had killed previously had refused his proposal and that he cannot understand their reasons for doing so
he tells the hashira to die while he is still young and strong and the two exchange attacks with the flame breathing fourth form blooming flame undulation and destructive death air type
kyojuro quickly deduces the nature of akazas fighting style deciding to close the distance to the upper rank
kyojuro and akaza exchange a clash of techniques
the demon compliments kyojuros reaction speed and the two exchange a flurry of blows
akaza also compliments the hashiras swordsmanship stating that losing these skills would be sad but kyojuro denies this
tanjiro attempts to stand to assist his superior but kyojuro orders him not to move on account of his recent wounds
akaza continues his assault on the hashira chiding him for paying attention to a weakling instead of focusing on the fight at hand
inosuke arrives just in time to see the two exchange another clash of techniques with kyojuro using the flame breathing fifth form flame tiger and akaza using his destructive death disorder
tanjiro looks on with concern as akaza tells an injured kyojuro not to die while inosuke notes that he cannot assist the hashira as he can sense that he would only be in the way
akaza warns kyojuro of the futility of his attacks and points out the extent of his numerous injuries while also noting that none of this would be an issue if he were a demon
kyojuro is impaled through the chest by akaza
tanjiro attempts to help his superior but cannot due to the side effects of the hinokami kagura
despite his injuries kyojuros determination is unwavering as he prepares to unleash his ultimateattack flame breathing esoteric art ninth form rengoku much to akazas delight
the upper rank responds with his own attack destructive death annihilation type causing a large explosion
tanjiro and inosuke watch helplessly as the dust clears to reveal kyojuro impaled through his solar plexus by akazas arm
the latter repeats his desire for the flame hashira to become a demon stating that he is one of the strong ones that has been chosen
kyojuro then has a flashback from his childhood where his mother asked him why he was born stronger than other people
the young kyojuro told her that he didn't know
she told him that it was to save the weak that it was the obligation of anyone born strong to fulfill this duty and to make sure he never forgot this to which kyojuro agreed
she then hugged her son tearfully noting that she would not be alive for much longer but that it was a blessing to be the mother of such a strong gentle child
kyojuro continues his attack on akaza despite his grievous injuries
back in the present the flame hashira swings his sword at akazas neck much to the latters astonishment
kyojuro thanks his mother for giving birth to him calling it an honor and presses the attack deeper into the demons neck
akaza attempts to punch the hashira with his free arm but kyojuro stops it with his own to the upper ranks continued shock
he then notices that the sun has begun to rise and attempts to finish kyojuro off but realizes that his arm is stuck in the hashiras abdomen
kyojuro determinedly vows to not let akaza escape
as the sun begins to rise tanjiro sees an opportunity to defeat akaza and rushes towards the demon
desperate to escape the sunlight akaza struggles to free himself from kyojuros grip but the hashiras burning determination keeps akaza trapped in place as his blade cuts his neck
tanjiro yells at inosuke to move for kyojuros sake and the masked youth complies rushing forward to attack akaza
as inosuke prepares to utilize his beast breathing first fang pierce the upper rank manages to escape at the last moment sacrificing both of his arms with kyojuros blade still stuck in his neck
he tries to flee into the nearby forest to escape the coming sunlight but tanjiro hurls his sword at the demon impaling him through the chest
the young demon slayer angrily chastises akaza for running away like a coward angering the upper rank
akaza looks back at tanjiro disgusted by his stupidity for thinking that he would be running away from them instead of trying to evade the sunlight
tanjiro continues his rant stating that the demon slayers would always risk their lives to hunt demons even at night when they were at a disadvantage and unable to regrow or repair their bodies
inosuke trembling after kyojuros fight
inosuke and tanjiro tremble after kyojuros fight
tanjiro calls akaza a coward as he escapes into the forest then proceeds to proclaim kyojuro to be stronger and the true victor of their battle
inosuke begins to tremble as he watches tanjiro begin to wail with tears streaming down his face
an appreciative kyojuro gently tells him to stop crying expressing his concern that tanjiros wounds would open up again
kyojuro tells him that if he reopens his wounds and dies from his injuries then kyojuro wouldve lost the battle from failing to protect his comrades
he proceeds to instruct tanjiro to come and have a final chat with him and the tearful youth complies
tanjiro sit's before kyojuro with tears streaming down his face as the hashira begins to relay what he had remembered from his flashbacks
four months after the passing of kyojuro rengoku the three boys have been training relentlessly at the butterfly mansion while occasionally leaving on individual missions
as zenit'su goes on solo missions he becomes less of a whiner whereas inosuke becomes more reckless
despite the unforgiving training sessions tanjiro remarks that theyre tolerable since the three boys can endure it together
tengen kidnapping aoi and naho ch70
tengen kidnapping aoi and naho
following the completion of one of his solo missions tanjiro approaches the butterfly mansion to hear the screams of the young girls
inside the property aoi and naho scream to be let go after the sound hashira tengen uzui begins to take them away while the other girls plea for their freedom
aoi calls out for kanaos help to save them although she initially hesitates on what to do kanao chases after tengen and grabs hold of aoi and naho
tengen looks at kanao and tells her to obey her orders but when she dosen't respond to him he gets agitated and tells her to say something while calling her a stuckup pig
the other girls get scared by his sudden yelling but they manage to muster up their courage to swarm and stop him from kidnapping aoi and naho
kanao trying to rescue aoi and naho
by this point tanjiro arrives inside the property and although he initially gets confused as to whether the girls are crowding him or attacking him he decides to headbutt tengen in order to free the girls
however tengen stealthily escapes the headbutt revealing that he previously used to be ninja and would not let anyone land an attack that
tanjiro angrily demands that tengen returns the girls while kiyo and sumi insult him with names causing tengen to get riled up at their disrespect and demand that they obey him as their superior officer
however tanjiro stubbornly refuses to acknowledge tengen as his superior causing him to explode with anger
during his fit of rage tengen explains that he needs female corps members in order to carry out his mission yelling that since they aren't tsuguko he dosen't need to ask shinobu for permission
it's an entertainment district where demons dwell
tengen announces their journey to the entertainment district
kiyo cries out that naho isnt a corps member so tengen nonchalantly throws her off the roof and decides to only take aoi
unwilling to give her up tanjiro demands that he gives her up and offers to go in her place
at that moment zenit'su and inosuke arrive to help protect the girls and they also offer to go on the mission as well
tengen ultimately gives in and smacks aoi on the behind before returning her to the girls
as the group of boys sets off on the mission the ask tengen where theyre going exactly to which he responds the flashiest place in japan steeped lust and avarice
ultimately revealing that they are heading towards the entertainment district
the chapter begins with tengen instructing and establishing his status as a superior to the trio of demon slayers
he specifically details his status as a god and demands that they bow and scrape and avert eyes
tengen establishes his rules
being genuinely intrigued tanjiro cheekily falls for his flamboyance and asks what it is that tengen rules over as a god
sensing the absurdity of the scenario zenit'su concludes that uzui is a sign of bad news and is also astonished by tanjiros naivety
tengen explains that he is the god of festivals and upon hearing this inosuke brazenly introduces himself as the god of the mountain and introduces himself as a fellow leaving tengen disgusted
tengen instructs the group to follow him to a wisteriacrested house where they will discuss their plans and within an instant he sprints a large distance till he can barely be seen leaving the group to chase after him in a panic
once they arrive at the home tengen informs the group to be on the lookout for someone he can marry which infuriates zenit'su
he angrily tells tengen to stop screwing around and to stop using members of the corps to be his matchmaker
tengen blows up and yells that he dosen't need a matchmaker since hes already married and that theyre searching for his wife who failed to respond to his letters
zenit'su dosen't believe him and tells tengen to stop telling his fantasies
causing tengen to angrily wack him in the face with the piles of letters
tanjiro begins to sift through the letters noticing the large quantity and comments that she must be a fast writer to which tengen clarifies that the large quantity is due to the fact that he has three wives
after hearing this zenit'sus head explodes with rage thinking that tengen is lying and he demands to know how he could have three wives
tengen gets angry at his remarks and punches zenit'su in the stomach with such force knocking him unconscious
inosuke getting punched by tengen
tanjiro begins to ask how they plan on sneaking into the district leaving tengen to explain that they will be disguised
his wives which are kunoichi were originally stationed there after he failed to find any leads as a customer but after they narrowed down the possible locations of where the demon might be they lost communication
overhearing the situation inosuke bluntly asks what if the wives are already dead to which tengen promptly punches him in the stomach knocking him unconscious
within the entertainment district a majority of the workers are individuals who were sold into the business due to poverty and debt
as a courtesan their job is to appeal and entertain customers so they can eventually find a wealthy man thats willing to buy their freedom
the highest classification of a courtesan is an oiran who is considered to be the most artistic beautiful and educated and is thus only reserved for the wealthiest of customers
inosuke tanjiro and zenit'su disguised as girls ch71
the boys disguised as girls
as the group finally arrives tengen uses his charming looks to try to give away the boys who are disguised as girls and is successfully able to give tanjiro away to the tokito house
tengen proceeds down the street with the other two boys in tow with zenit'su seething with anger at the fact that tengen is proudly flaunting his visuals
inosuke and tengen notice a courtesan precession coming towards them on the street and learn that the orian named koinatsu is on her way to greet a suitor
zenit'su notices the orian and angrily yells at tengen demanding to know if thats his wife as well earning him a punch in the face
a woman approaches tengen and asks him if he is looking for a house and offers to take inosuke into the ogimoto house to which tengen accepts
the chapter concludes with zenit'su fearfully realizing that he is the only one left with tengen
tanjiro is left shocked by tengens swift victory over daki but the sound hashira reminds him that the fight isnt over as his sister is still out of control
tanjiro struggles to restrain her with tengen suggesting he sing her a lullaby to put her to sleep
at that moment nezuko regains her footing and jumps out of the window taking her brother with her as they continue to struggle
realizing his words aren't reaching her tanjiro asks his mother what he should do and then remembers tengens earlier advice to sing nezuko a lullaby
he begins to sing her a song that their mother had sung in the past and while her actions remain unchanged at first his lullaby soon reaches her
nezuko remembers asking their mother about the song when she was a child causing her to break down in tears
nezuko comes to her senses and changes from her advanced demonized form back into her regular childlike state promptly falling asleep
tanjiro lets out a relieved sigh as he successfully holds nezuko in his lap
daki throws a tantrum
daki begins to throw a tantrum over tengen denying her upper rank status
back in the house daki screams at tengen for cutting her head off and he responds by telling her to die quietly
the enraged demon reminds him that he had denied her upper rank status which he affirms but she proceeds to insist her status much to his annoyance
emerging from her body dakis brother confronts tengen
to the hashiras astonishment daki begins to throw a tantrum and cry and he notes that she has been talking for far too long when she should have showed signs of dying
still throwing her tantrum daki calls out to gyutaro
to save her and a male demon begins to emerge from her body
tengen senses the danger and attempts to immediately attack the two but his blades hit nothing but air as the demons disappear from his sight
on the other side of the room behind tengen gyutaro comforts daki asking that she at least try to reattach her own head
tengen wonders why daki is still alive after being beheaded as well as the presence of the new demon who he comments as having great reaction speed
gyutaro tells daki to heal her burn complimenting her good looks and wounds tengen when he attempts to attack them again
gyutaro compliments tengens attempt to attack him as well as his success at blocking his attack
he reveals that he was intending to kill tengen with that attack and eerily prepares to him on in a battle
within the entertainment district there are men known as gyus
or barkers who work to attract customers to enter the brothels
gyutaro worked as one of these men and eventually named himself using the word gyu
inside one of the brothels gyutaro and tengen are about to engage in combat but before they do so gyutaro begins to analyze tengens appearance
he comments about his nice face good skin and height mentioning that he must attract a lot of attention from women
gyutaro begins to eerily scratch at his face until he begins to bleed and voices his jealousy over tengens looks
in the corner of the room daki can be seen crying as she whines at gyutaro to kill the other demon slayers who burned her as well
she proceeds to tell him that they ganged
up on her and she tried her hardest to kill her causing gyutaro to seethe with anger
using two large sickles he creates a flurry of large arclike slashes aiming them towards tengen
elsewhere in the district tanjiro can be seen carrying nezuko as he rushes to put her away to safety
he looks up into the sky and sees the sickles return back in the direction that they came like a boomerang he becomes concerned when he smells tengens blood and rushes to return to help
at that moment inosuke and zenit'su can be seen prancing towards him as they comically announce their arrival
tanjiro quickly informs them to help tengen and inosuke reassures him that hes going to be reeeeal
flashy before pardoning tanjiro to put nezuko in her box
gyutaro using his blood demon art
back at the brothel gyutaro seethes with jealousy after witnessing how cool
tengen looks by protecting the bystanders within the home causing him to brag about his appearance and marriage to three women
gyutaro pauses in astonishment before furiously scratching his face after hearing of tengens polygamy he proceeds to use his blood demon art flying blood sickles to try to kill the hashira but tengen manages to block it
a large explosion causes the floor beneath tengen to give in and he manages to escape by dropping down one floor however gyutaro commands his sickles to turn and they come straight for tengen yet again
daki and gyutaro fighting together
daki fights alongside gyutaro
by this point tengen has realized gyutaros ability to change the sickles direction and tries to formulate a plan on how to defeat the siblings
he therorizes that in order to kill the demons he would need to cut off gyutaros head instead of dakis and he tries to test it out
tengen grabs 3 small balls and throws them into the air he proceeds to aim for them and precisely hit's them to cause an explosion within the brothel
as the brothel begins to crumble tengen is seen standing on the rubble as he admit's it won't be easy to defeat the demons
he looks at the large obi ball before him and the siblings emerge unscathed as they confidently proclaim that they fight as one
after successfully finding the box and returning nezuko inside tanjiro quickly tries to return to the battlefield in order to assist tengen uzui
tengen grows angry with the demons
tengen becomes fed up with gyutaros comments
back at the battlefield gyutaro scowls as he mentions tengens supreme abilities calling him different and talented compared to the other hashira hes killed
his comments somewhat irritate tengen and he berates him for thinking that hes talented compared to other people on the planet calling him ignorant
he grows more and more angry as he recalls the people hes lost over the years despite being called the supposed chosen
after listening to him speak gyutaro grows irritated at the fact that he has not died yet revealing that his poison drenched sickles should have killed him
tengen explains that he has built a resistance to poison as he was raised in a shinobi household with nine siblings but by the age of fifteen seven of them had already died
his father was a cold and heartless individual who would regularly forced them to undergo intense training and as a result his brother adopted the same ruthless and cold hearted personality
unable to understand that type of mindset tengen left his clan alongside his wives and approached kagaya ubuyashiki to become members of the corps
kagaya had warned them it would be hard to reject the values they were raised in but openly welcomed and thanked tengens family for deciding to put their lives at risk to protect others
tengen attacks daki and gyutaro
tengen attacks the siblings
in the present gyutaro notices the deterioration in tengens physical state and becomes gleeful when he realizes that his poison is slowly taking effect
tengen proceeds to refute his claim saying that he is still in pristine condition and charges forward to attack the siblings
as they engage in a battle tengen manages to kick daki away from gyutaro and releases numerous dark beads which cause a cluster of explosions
by setting a distraction tengen attempts to decapitate gyutaro while only hold the tip of one end of his blades but it is promptly blocked by the demon
as both sides reassess the situation daki is left whining as she pathetically reattaches her head to her body once again
gyutaro confronts tengen about discovering the method on how to defeat them but he feigns his innocence pretending not to notice
inosuke and zenit'su arrive to help tengen
zenit'su and inosuke arrive to assist in the battle
despite tengens discovery gyutaro cockingly says that despite knowing their weakness tengen will still die from the poisoning since the demons have the advantage in the battle
at that moment zenit'su and inosuke arrive to question the validity of gyutaros claim that theyre going to win
the two boys flamboyantly announce their arrival to the fight which confuses everyone at the moment but then tanjiro drops down from the ceiling above them and stands between the injured tengen and the demons preparing to fight
makio and suma can be seen frantically trying trying to evacuate the citizens of the district as the battle resumes against the demons
gyutaro tries to discourage and the three new arrivals and manages to intimidate tanjiro however tengen uzui comes up behind them and proudly announces that theyre going to win
as daki finishes reattaching her head she loudly doubts his words by saying that they can't win since the hashira has been poisoned
tanjiro envisions kyojuro when tengen speaks
unfazed tengen once again proudly announces their intent to win and speaks highly of the three boys
looking back at him tanjiro sees the persona of kyojuro rengoku emitting from tengen as he speaks which excites inosuke
gyutaro nearly striking tanjiro
gyutaro and daki get riled up and reveal that theyve eaten 15 and 7 hashira respectively and begin to attack the group
as daki attempts to attack tengen and tanjiro from behind zenit'su bursts through the home within seconds to block the attack as inosuke follows him
now on the rooftop daki finally recognizes zenit'su from the kyogoku house and he demandingly commands her to apologize to the girl whom he had found crying earlier
she mocks his speech by revealing that women are treated like merchandise within the district and as the orian she was allowed to do as she pleased with other people since she was the main breadwinner of the house
when she looks up at zenit'su a third eye appears on dakis forehead revealing that gyutaro can see them via her new eye
inosuke and zenit'su face daki
zenit'su and inosuke face daki
back in the brothel tanjiro becomes intimidated by gyutaros evil aura but formulates a plan to counter his attacks and protect tengen
however the demon manages to rush towards tanjiro within an instant and catch him off guard narrowly piercing him through his jaw
before he can do so tengen grabs tanjiro by the nape of his clothes and throws him to safety before engaging in battle with gyutaro
as he crash lands and looks back to see the two fighting tanjiro senses an ominous object approaching them from above and dakis obi can be seen crashing down all around them
on the rooftop daki can be heard cackling as she admit's she is now displaying her full strength since gyutaro is awake and allowing her to used his enhanced senses
zenit'su and inosuke can be seen covered in cuts and wounds as they prepare to engage with daki in battle
the chapter concludes with gyutaro disregarding tengens claims of the boys being tsuguko undermining their capabilities as swordsmen
the demon slayers can be seen engaging in battle with the two demons of the entertainment district fighting ferociously on the rooftop and inside one of the brothels
as the building begins to collapse tengen uzui finds himself getting cornered between two of gyutaros attacks however tanjiro jumps in and manages to protect him from the slashes
tengen proceeds to use sound breathing fifth form string performance to try to corner gyutaro but dakis obi interferes and protects her brother from the attacks
hinatsuru using her kunai box
tengen begins to be pushed back by the obi however tanjiro moves in to cut the obi and tries to distract gyutaro
the hashira is left amazed at tanjiros endurance despite suffering a serious shoulder wound and realizes that tanjiro had tied his sword to his hand to prevent him from dropping it due to exhaustion
meanwhile on the rooftop inosuke and zenit'su can be seen struggling as they try to evade the attacks from dakis obi
the boys realize that daki is know attacking them with the blood blades used by gyutaro making it impossible for them to approach her
now that the brothel has been destroyed tengen and tanjiro are left to fight gyutaro and the obi beneath the night sky
on a nearby rooftop hinatsuru appears carrying a large box filled with kunai darts and proceeds to launch dozens of them down below onto gyutaro
at first he is left confused behind the random attack but then gyutaro utilizes his blood demon art rampant arc rampage to deflect them away from him
gyutaro using his blood demon art
gyutaro is left shocked when tengen proceeds to attack him despite getting pierced with the darts
he attempts to decapitate him with his sickle however tengen manages to evade his attack and successfully cut off his legs
at that moment gyutaro is struck on the neck by one of the kunai darts and fails to regenerate his feet realizing that the darts were coated with wisteria extract
as his body begins to go numb tanjiro closes in on him to try to decapitate gyutaro leaving him seething with curiosity as the demon slayers quickly gain the upper hand
the kunai darts which were utilized by hinatsuru were revealed to be coated in a poison which would generally paralyze a demon for half a day or possibly immobilize a lower rank
she can be seen on a nearby rooftop pleading for the poison to work for even just a moment as the demon slayers attempt to decapitate gyutaro
however at that moment gyutaro manages to regenerate his legs and proceeds to attack them at a close vicinity
rotating circular slashes flying blood scythes
gyutaro uses his blood demon art
he uses his blood demon art rotating circular slashes flying blood scythes to emit numerous blood slashes to attack them
before they can reach him tengen uzui grabs hold of tanjiro and throws him back to protect him from the attack
within seconds tengen uses sound breathing fourth form constant resounding slashes to deflect gyutaros attack but finds that he has disappeared from sight
to his horror he looks up to the roof only to see that gyutaro has managed to capture hinatsuru and is about to kill her
tanjiro saves hinatsuru from gyutaro
tengen tries to save her however dakis obi blocks him from reaching her
he thinks back to a moment in the past when hinatsuru had asked to retire from the corps following their mission specifically remembering her asking to not harbor any regrets if any of them were to die
back in the present tengen yells at gyutaro to stop as he tries to push through
tanjiro comes close to the building and tries to use the hinokami kagura to reach her however his body refuses to listen to him
tanjiro quickly changes tactics and uses a form of the water breathing to quickly save hinatsuru from gyutaro
realizing that he managed to save hinatsuru tanjiro decides to utilize both the water breathing as well as the hinokami kagura in order to increase his attacking power
gyutaro is left surprised by tanjiros unexpected maneuver and charges at him
however at that moment tengen comes behind gyutaro and swings his blade at gyutaros neck while openly yelling that he owes tanjiro
on a nearby rooftop inosuke can see tengen move in as he attempts to cut off gyutaros head
his frustration grows as they continue to evade dakis attacks instead of move in to try to decapitate her
zenit'su calls out to inosuke and explains that in order to defeat them they just need to make sure their heads aren't connected instead of trying to decapitate the two simultaneously
inosuke comically looks at zenit'su amazed and calls him awesome after seeing the difference in his personality compared to his usual demeanor
gyutaro catches tengens blade
gyutaro catches tengens blade in his mouth
meanwhile tanjiro assists tengen by also trying to swing his blade down onto gyutaros neck however the demon manages to use his sickles to halt both of their attacks and attempts to absorb their blades
tengen uses his free arm to use his second blade to pierce the gyutaro but his quick reflexes allow him to catch the tip of the blade in his mouth
sensing that gyutaro is about to unleash more blood blades tengen tells tanjiro to hang in there as hinatsuru yanks tanjiro away from them allowing tengen to leap off of the roof while pulling the demon with him
before he can leap down to help them a voice can be heard telling them to watch out as inosuke and zenit'su crash onto the roof while fighting the obi
inosuke and zenit'su ask tanjiro for help in order to defeat daki and agrees asking that they finish quickly in order to help tengen
hinatsuru tells the boys that she will hide quickly in order to allow them to focus on the battle and disappears as they face daki
thunderclap and flash eightfold
inosuke tanjiro and zenit'su attacking daki
she gets excited when tanjiro joins their fight and informs his comrades that they need a fast attack in order to cut her neck
inosuke realizes that she has slowed down and decides to go first to attack as zenit'su agrees with tanjiro to protect him from behind
inosuke proceeds to dash forward using beast breathing eighth fang explosive rush while zenit'su and tanjiro use thunder breathing first form thunderclap and flash eightfold and water breathing third form flowing dance respectively to protect inosuke from the obi
daki begins to crack under the pressure as inosuke close in on her and manages to draw both of his blades on either side of her neck
inosuke buries his heels into the ground as he uses beast breathing sixth fang palisade bite to effectively decapitate daki
tanjiro smiles with joy as he witnesses inosuke leap and catch dakis head in the air rejoicing at successfully cutting off her head
inosuke claims they have to act fast and keep her head separated from her body
having successfully decapitated daki inosuke can be seen escaping with her head in order to prevent her from reattaching it to her body
he tells the other boys not to worry about him and to instead help tengen but before he can get to safety daki uses her hair to put up a resistance
gyutaro stabs inosuke to rescue his sister
he manages to put a stop to her resistance but before he can get away gyutaro appears behind him and impales him through the chest
tanjiro looks on in horror as gyutaro grabs dakis head while inosuke collapses on the roof he then looks down on the ground and is once again horrified to see tengen laying bleeding and unresponsive on the ground
zenit'su tries to warn tanjiro of the oncoming obi attack but before he can escape the roof collapses from beneath him and tanjiro falls to the ground seemingly buried beneath the rubble
as he falls unconscious he apologizes to everyone and specifically to nezuko for losing the battle
nezuko appears in tanjiros dream
nezuko appears while tanjiro is unconscious
in his dream nezuko can be seen telling him to stop apologizing for any faults in their lives or for feeling unworthy
she reassures him that it isnt his fault that their lives were ruined and tells him theyll work together to make a better future for themselves
nezuko begins to cry as her body morphs from her human form to her demon form and she pleads for him to never apologize for any regrets and tells him she understands how he feels
tanjiro awakens from his dream and tries to recollect his thoughts but before he gets up gyutaro can be seen standing over him questioning if hes still alive
gyutaro takes it upon himself to tell tanjiro that inosuke was pierced through the heart zenit'su was suffering and trapped beneath the rubble and tengens heart had stopped due to the poison
he proceeds to refer to all of them as pathetic and asks tanjiro how the demon in the box is related to him and he responds by saying shes his younger sister
gyutaro begins to laugh at tanjiros pathetic attempt to protect his sister and tells him he should be using his hands before proceeding to break his fingers
tanjiro makes a final effort to escape
as tanjiro withers on the ground in pain gyutaro proceeds to berate him for his weakness and pulls him by the hair
he teases tanjiro and tells him to try to decapitate him but instead of attacking him he slaps his hand on a small bag and hangs his head down in defeat
believing that he broke tanjiros fighting spirit he reveals his grand idea of offering tanjiro the opportunity to become a demon for the sake of his sister
tanjiro suddenly looks up into the sky and gyutaro asks him if hes trying to hold back his tears but to his surprise tanjiro responds that he had been preparing for the moment
with his face gets close to gyutaros tanjiro brings his head down and headbutts him with a great force momentarily stunning him
daki screams at him to get up but as his legs falter and looks down to discover that a kunai dart has been lodged into his leg
he realizes that when tanjiro had looked down he opened a bag given to him by hinatsuru which contained wisteria poison
tanjiro manages to stand up while gyutaro remains paralyzed and crouched before him and uses his remaining strength to swing the blade down onto his neck
having regained his footing and subdued gyutaro tanjiro manages to draw his blade onto gyutaros neck and press down to try to decapitate him
as he try to forces the blade down tanjiro envisions himself in gyutaros place and thinks that if he were in his situation he would want his comrades to kill him before he could live as a demon

at the beginning of the chapter it is revealed that the demon siblings were able to keep the demon slayers at bay through a hidden ability
during the battle gyutaro was controlling his sister and was able to see through her point of view giving them the advantage

as gyutaros body falls onto the ground tengen notices something being emitted from it and becomes alarmed
meanwhile up on a nearby rooftop suma hinatsuru and makio have arrived to witness the end of the battle
as makio begins to bicker with suma over her behavior hinatsuru notices something is amiss down on the battlefield
she looks down to see tanjiro struggling to breathe as he bleeds out from his jaw while trying to slow down the poison
tanjiro looks over at tengen whos sitting down in front of him and yelling at him with a panicked expression
however tanjiro fails to comprehend his sudden alarm as tengen looks at him with horror
underneath the night sky nezuko can be seen looking down at her brother with a concerned expression
as tanjiro begins to regain consciousness he looks around to see the destroyed buildings around him
nezuko nudges her brother as a way of letting him know that she was the one who saved him from the destruction
tanjiro attempts to get up to search for the others but his legs give out from beneath him and he collapses onto the ground
he hears someone calling out to him in the distance and recognizes the voice as belonging to zenit'su and is unexpectedly picked up and carried by nezuko
the pair move towards the source of the commotion and discover zenit'su has awakened from his slumber not remembering any of the events that had transpired
he tells tanjiro that he can hear inosukes heartbeat get weaker and weaker and points to him laying unconscious nearby
nezuko heals inosuke by setting him on fire
the siblings rush over to him and tanjiro attempts to wake inosuke up but to his dismay he feels his heart get weaker
tanjiro begins to panic and thinks of exposing him to sunlight or sending a crow to shinobu for help but realizes he dosen't have time for either of the options
his tears begin to well up as inosuke lays dying before him but nezuko comes forward and unexpectedly sets inosuke on fire
tanjiro looks on amazed as he witnesses inosukes poisoned skin heal right before his eyes and his comrade suddenly awakens to announce hes hungry
the three rejoice at the fact that hes okay and embrace as tanjiro begins to sob
elsewhere on the battlefield suma begins to wail loudly while pleading for tengen to live after winning the battle

realizing that he dosen't have much time left to live tengen begins to relay his final words to his wives but is interrupted by sumas loud wails
makio becomes enraged at sumas overreactive cries and begins to pull her by the hair and shove rocks into her mouth to make her be quiet while hinatsuru tries to prevent them from bickering
in a comical fashion tengen sit's spectating as his wives continue to bicker while his final moments slip away he then realizes that he can no longer move his speak due to the poison

everyone momentarily pauses when nezuko suddenly appears next to tengen they proceed to stare at her as she raises her hand and grabs his arm before setting him on fire
his wives look on in horror until suma comically pulls nezuko away saying that it's too soon to cremate him
to their surprise tengen begins to speak again and asks how it's possible that the poison has been removed from his body bringing relief to his wives
tanjiro subtly explains that nezukos blood demon art has somehow managed to remove the poison from their bodies and expresses his relief to know that tengen is safe
tengen tries to tell tanjiro to rest if not he will die from his injuries but he informs tengen that he needs to confirm that the demons have been defeated before he can rest
gyutaro arguing with daki
the demon siblings begin to argue as they disintegrate
the siblings proceed throughout the rubble in search of the demons heads and come across a pool of demon blood
tanjiro pulls out an apparatus and decides to collect the blood in order to be studied
once the blood has been collected tamayos cat familiar chachamaru appears before tanjiro and he puts it in the box to be delivered to tamayo
as the siblings continue their search tanjiro smells the scent of the demons and guides nezuko to head towards them
when they arrive gyutaro and daki can be seen viciously arguing over their defeat
their heads begin to disintegrate as they blame each other for losing the battle with gyutaro degrading daki for being useless
daki retaliates by saying that someone as ugly as gyutaro cannot be considered her relative which leaves tanjiro looking at them concerned about the hurtful words they are spewing at each other
daki and gyutaro continue arguing as their heads begin to disintegrate she starts chastising her brother for being useless and questions if theyre even related
gyutaro grows angry at her comments and calls her a weakling even regretting protecting her in the first place
he loses his temper and goes on to spew hateful remarks such as mentioning that his life wouldve been better without her and wishing that she had never been born causing dakis eyes to well up with tears
tanjiro intervenes and covers gyutaros mouth stating that he dosen't mean what hes saying and that they shouldn't spend their final moments fighting with each other
daki begins to wail at tanjiro out of frustration yelling at him to leave them alone and stop lecturing them
dakis head reaches it's last phases of disintegration and she cries out for her brother to save her saying that she dosen't want to die
gyutaro hopelessly watches as her head dissolves away while still calling out him before he impulsively calls out to her by her birth name ume
as he reaches his final moments gyutaro recalls his past as a human born in the kirimise to a prostitute mother
before she died from syphilis his mother tried to kill him many times even after his younger sister was born
due to his appearance his voice and lack of hygiene the young gyutaro was bullied and detested by everyone he met
things began to change after his sister was born as her beauty dismissed his inferiority complex and he used his ugliness plus his newfound fighting skills to become an efficient debt collector
gyutaro returns from a job only to find his sister horribly burned due to the actions of a vengeful samurai
however the good fortune would not last for the siblings
when ume turned 13 she blinded a samurai with a comb and was subsequently burned alive for her crime
having been away on his job at the time gyutaro returned to find her barely alive and hugged her as she clinged to life
he cursed the gods to return his sister and for treating them cruelly before he is attacked by the same samurai
the samurai slashes gyutaro from behind allowing him to bleed out at he chats with one of the brothel managers
the manager brazingly calls gyutaro a nuisance and a brute for harassing the locals of the district before expressing her pity at having lost ume as a courtesan
before the samurai could finish him off gyutaro viciously kills the manager and berates the samurai for having a lavish lifestyle before gruesomely killing him as well by snapping his katana and slicing his head in half with his sickle
as gyutaro tried to find help for him and his sister no one would help them due to their reputation and circumstances
he trudges on through the street until he ultimately collapses and bleeds out on the floor as snow begins to fall
the siblings lay on the floor dying until they are discovered by one of the upper ranks who offers to turn them into demons
gyutaro adamantly proclaims that he would become a demon again no matter how many times he is reborn wanting to always bring fear as gyutaro the debt collector
gyutaro muses how daki could have been if he had raised her differently before taking note of his surroundings
a younger looking daki appeared behind him disgusted with their current location and wondering where the exit was
the emaciated man ordered her not to follow him anymore getting angry when she wouldn't comply
a tearful daki apologized for her earlier cruel insults stating that it was because she had not wanted to accept that it was her fault that they had lost
when gyutaro still refused to let her come with him daki tackled him from behind stubbornly refusing to ever let go vowing to always be his little sister no matter how often they are reborn and reminding him of the promise they had made long ago to always stay together
finally accepting her company gyutaro carries his sister into the fire that await's them
hearing the news about the defeat of one of the upper ranks kagaya is determined to see muzan defeated in his generation
in the world of the living tanjiro and nezuko watch as the last of the demon siblings dissolves into the air
tanjiro wonders if they made up which nezuko affirms
elsewhere obanai iguro attempts to praise tengen for his defeat of upper rank 6 but is disappointed that he beat such a low ranking member of the twelve kizuki as well as lost his left arm and eye
tengen states his intention to retire as a hashira but obanai refuses to accept this as there is already a vacan't hashira position and the lower ranks of the demon slayer corps keep on dying without improving
tengen disagrees with this last point stating that tanjiro is definitely improving while obanai is surprised he survived the fight
elsewhere kagaya ubuyashiki learns of the groups victory and is elated but is stricken by complications from his illness
he states that this victory will have massive consequences enough to ensure muzan kibutsujis defeat within their generation and then collapses into a bout of coughing
at the infinity castle akaza ponders how his summoning must mean a member of the upper ranks has been defeated
akaza looks on with displeasure as the biwa demon plays her instrument and is greeted by one of his upper rank colleagues gyokko
the potted demon asks him how hes been after ninety years and proclaims his insincere worry over akaza being the slain upper rank
hantengu corrects his colleague as it had actually been one hundred and thirteen years since they had last been summoned and expresses his concern over the oddity and unluckiness of the number
ignoring them akaza asks the biwa demon if muzan had arrived the answer being no and then asks if upper rank 1 had arrived
before she can answer doma places a hand on akazas shoulder asking him to show some concern for his wellbeing as he did not wish to see any of his precious buddies
gyokko and doma exchange small talk about the formers pot and latters use of the pot that gyokko had given him
akaza demands that doma remove his hand viciously punching him when he dosen't immediately do so
quickly recovering from the blow doma pleasantly asks if akaza had gotten stronger since they last met enraging the tattooed demon
the biwa demon finally relates that upper rank 1 had been the first to arrive surprising akaza who quickly spotted his silent colleague
kokushibo noted that he was present as was their master
as each upper rank reacted to the silent arrival of their leader muzan noted that gyutaro was dead
doma apologized for gyutaros failure wondering what punishment muzan would give him but the ancient demon declined all of his suggestions having already anticipated upper rank 6s defeat
he further commented that he didn't expect anything from them which doma questioned as he did not believe he had ever failed to live up to his masters expectations
muzan countered by stating that the ubuyashiki family had yet to be killed and the blue spider lily had yet to be found making him question why the upper ranks even existed
each of the upper ranks offers some excuse for this failure save akaza and gyokko
the latter offers muzan some information he claims will get him closer to achieving his goals
akaza destroys domas head

he demands that the upper ranks serve him with suicidal devotion
from that moment on orders gyokko to head over with hantengu if he can confirm his information and then leaves

suddenly a dark figure appears behind them and tanjiro notices that it does not smell like any of the previous emotion demons
opting to ignore it he keeps trying to behead hantengu but his sword loses it's power from nezuko kamado
genya shinazugawa aims at the figure behind tanjiro but he is unable to shoot without possibly hitting his teammate
the mysterious demon hit's a drum and a giant dragonfaced tree immediately sprouts
nezuko barely manages to jump in and save her brother losing her leg in the process
she immediately regrows it right before they land but suffers a great loss of energy
as tanjiro makes sure she is safe the demon begins talking and names the negative emotions that individuals who are pure evil emit specifically those that harm the weak
infuriated tanjiro realizes that there are now six demons but notices he can’t sense the previous four
genya witnesses the appearance of the sixth demon and alarmingly recounts how it used to be the anger demon sekido
however after tanjiro struck hantengu’s neck sekido had forcefully absorbed his three counterparts and transformed into the childlike demon in front of them

the demon hit's another drum and wraps hantengu with tree trunks shielding him
tanjiro tries to stop him but he and genya are both held back at the pure strength of the sixth demon’s aura a result of hantengu’s power growing as his situation worsens
the demon labels them as ‘evil’ and when tanjiro demands an explanation as to why he replies that the label is reserved to those who try to hurt the weak
furious at his words contradicting the fact that he had eaten hundreds of innocent humans tanjiro loudly vows to cut him down

elsewhere on the estate sakonji is seen caring an ill nezuko he reveals that he had given nezuko a medication to revert her back to a human but questioned if it was actually taking any effect
the idea of nezuko returning to a human would ruin muzans scheme of trying to conquer the sun and she would be deemed the only demon in history to not be destroyed by sunlight

now behind him tanjiro wills himself to slice akazas arm off and successfully manages to do so but is swiftly attacked when akaza manages to regenerate his arm
to his advantage tanjiro narrowly avoids his attack by using hinokami kagura fake rainbow and manages to slice akaza across the face in the process
akaza regenerates his cut while he stares stunned at tanjiros ability
after having witnessed their small scuffle giyu stands amazed at tanjiros techniques thinking of how his ability is equal to that of a hashiras
he recalls the snow day of when they first met and how all he could do was beg for his sisters life compared to how he can now fight without losing his life or dignity
akaza recalls the final words spoken to him by kyojuro this boy isnt weak do not insult him
and acknowledges tanjiros strength and informs him of his newfound respect for him
the chapter ends with akaza initiating a technique development destructive death compass needle to fight tanjiro in a serious manner
giyu uses the water breathing third form flowing dance to maneuver around akaza the latter recognizing him as the water hashira and stating it has been fifty years since he had faced a hashira that uses the water breathing
akaza responds by using his destructive death disorder disrupting giyus movements and forcing him to use the water breathing eleventh form dead calm to negate the attack
the upper moon mentions the last water hashira he faced never used such a form
tanjiro appears from behind using the hinokami kagura raging sun to slash at akazas neck only for the blow to miss and for the demon to appear behind him instead about to punch through his neck
tanjiro nearly gets hit trying to use the hinokami kagura fake rainbow to dodge when giyu saves him by slicing akazas arm off using the water breathing second form water wheel
akazas arm grows back nearly instantly however and giyu quickly attacks again followed by tanjiro using the hinokami kagura flame dance
akaza sees him trying to slice his foot and uses leg type crown splitter knocking the demon slayer
tanjiro tries to parry with his blade and though he nearly comes unscathed akazas leg catches tanjiros nose slightly causing him to bleed heavily from the sheer force
tanjiro crouches down to soak up the pain leading giyu to face akaza alone
akaza compliments his opponents sword and asks for his name only to be denied i don't have a name to tell to a demon
and i hate talking so don't bother
the demon happily responds he loves talking and will continually asking till he gives in using leg type explosive flurry to hit his blade handle and knocking the hashira away through several walls
tanjiro sees the impact and calls at to giyu only for akaza to appear alongside him excited he now knows his opponents name
the two swing at each other tanjiro using the hinokami kagura burning bones summer sun and akaza deploying his destructive death eightlayered demon core in retaliation
akaza survives the clash unscatched while tanjiro is forced back slamming into a wall
akaza compliments his moves and for training in a short amount of time
he praises kyojuro rengoku for the day of their battle as tanjiro was a weakling lying down that night
now however he sees tanjiros growth in battle and is now excited to face him
akaza voices his gratitude at kyojuros death as he believes he would never had become stronger than that day also insulting his belief to remain human
tanjiro hears these words and remembering kyojuro shinjuro and senjuro becomes enraged telling him to stop insulting the former flame hashira
akaza is confused retorting he is praising the two while tanjiro only tells him he is insulting kyojuro as well as hating anyone who faces him
the demon claims tanjiro is misunderstanding as he only hates the weak repulsed by them and stating the laws of nature dictate the weak become eliminated
the demon slayer responds back that the upper rank himself is the product of his wrong views as he was once weak as well and had become powerful
tanjiro yells that the strong protect the weak
then the weak get stronger and help those weaker than themselves calling it the true laws of nature
he calls akazas belief unforgivable and voices he will not let him do as he like any further
facing off against tanjiro akaza cannot brush aside the unpleasant feeling he is giving him
he is unsure why he feels angry fighting him since he believes tanjiro is no longer weak yet cannot shake the feeling of his eyes voice and words cutting into him
at that moment someone grabs akazas shoulder and confirms tanjiros words everyone starts off weak they get help from everyone around them but he should only compare his own progress against himself not that of others
the man tells him the only thing important is becoming stronger than he was yesterday and soon he can be the one to help people
angered akaza tries to punch behind him to hit the man but strikes nothing
as a bewildered tanjiro sees akaza punch the air suddenly akaza angrily mutters tanjiro you really are unpleasant
akaza uses destructive death crushing type tenthousand leaves flashing willow and ruptures the ground around him with tanjiro just barely dodging the attack
as he becomes stunned at akazas new speed the demon then quickly engages the demon slayer from below and uses his destructive death leg type flying planet thousand wheels with tanjiro taking the attack and vomiting as a result
he tries to reason as to how akaza manages to nearly hit him with every move all his strikes seem to aim for his vital areas and his attacks seem to be attracted to them
he thinks back to when the demon deploys his technique development destructive death compass needle but before he can figure it out tanjiro dodges to the side to escape an incoming kick
tanjiro uses the hinokami kagura solar heat haze but only manages to cut half way through akazas neck who manages to heal the cut instantly
however the upper rank is curious as to how the tip manages to appear hazy before hitting him asking the demon slayer how he did it
elsewhere in the rengoku estate senjuro prays to his late brother kyojuro that a major battle is now active pleading him to protect tanjiro
senjuro thinks to his written letter to tanjiro where he detailed information from the flame hashira chronicles about a conversation between the sun breathing swordsman and the flame hashira of that time how the swordsman was the first breathing user and had engage muzan in battle
as senjuro continues to pray to his brother that tanjiro will survive it is revealed the kasugai crow with his letter is sitting nearby watching the battle forcing tanjiro to survive the battle in order to read it
as tanjiro attempts to use his hinokami kagura fire wheel akaza catches the blade in his hands
startled that he will attempt to break it tanjiro headbutts the demon but dosen't injure akaza
he attempts to kick him but akaza continues to grasp the sword
suddenly akazas hands are sliced off freeing tanjiro and his sword
giyu returns angered at the searing pain in his back and sarcastically thanking the upper moon for blasting him through several walls
tanjiro remembers how his father seemed like a plant he had never shown any emotional outburst and was always gentle maintaining his demeanour till his death
whenever he remembers him he immediately pictures his soft smile and calming voice
tanjiro remembers a question he asked him about what he thinks when he performs the hinokami kagura
even as a child tanjiro knew that the dance involved performing all twelve moves from night to dawn continuously
worried about his frail body tanjiro asks if he can be the one to do it next year
tanjuro thanks his son for his concern but brushes aside his worry stating that every year he performed it he never tired
he remembers learning it from his own father but notes that even though he was younger and healthier then doing it exhausted him greatly
he figured out though the forms had useless moves what mattered was using the correct breathing and movements as well as releasing all your strength through minimal movement
tanjuro states that by doing this your mind becomes invisible but to properly do so he had to find his movement and sensations utilise all his senses and gain complete awareness of your body
he tells his son that by doing all this he can learn to remove unneeded parts of the hinokami kagura and learn just to do what is necessary and close off everything else
tanjiro asks how can he close everything else and his father responds by saying it's like people closing their eyes to hear better
as he does this his body will adapt and the movements will become natural
tanjuro tells him that when your mind becomes invisible he will see into the transparen't world but this is the end as his body would have reached it's limit
as an amazed tanjiro asks if he can do it as well he is told he can do so by working hard and not slacking off while being presented with new warajis
an incident happened ten days before tanjuros death a bear had come to the mountain killing and devouring people
as the kamado family sleeps through a blizzard tanjuro suddenly awakens and gets up after which he asks his sleepy eldest son to accompany him
as tanjuro and tanjiro wander outside the two encounter the very bear two metres tall and believed to have killed six people
a frightened tanjiro watches his father confront the bear with only an axe and his frail body
tanjuro apologises for it's hunger but warns the creature that coming any closer will mean facing him
he tells it that if anything tries to harm his family he will show no mercy and take it's life
as the bear roars and lumbers forward to kill him tanjuro swings his axe and leaps up decapitating the bear before it could move a step
as it's giant head drops to the ground tanjiro tries to piece what had happened in that instant tanjuro would have to swing twice to get completely through it's neck and with his sense of smell he realises tanjuro never wavered in the slightest
he had no hesitation fear no intent to kill with his plantlike presence he simply killed it
tanjuro looks behind and asks if his son had witnessed what happened
a shaken tanjiro confirms he saw what took place and runs up to hug him
as he tells his son to never forget what he saw tanjiro looks back and realised this moment was a form of training his perception
he was supposed to learn to see into the transparen't world like his father grandfather and greatgrandfather before him they would have had to learn in this way
he finally understand his fathers words and thinks back when he manage to suddenly dodge akazas strike that seemed about to connect
though it would have surely killed him he manage to escape it
for just a slight moment when akaza grabbed his blade and was poised to swing tanjiro had entered the transparen't world seeing akazas muscles through his body as he did to hantengu
managing to close off other sense to dodge something unavoidable his body became even faster
apologising to inosuke for doubting him tanjiro steels his resolve that while giyu battles akaza he will use this new power to his best ability and beat the demon
having seen the transparen't world momentarily tanjiro realizes his own movement and speed had increased greatly he was able to see how akazas body reacts in battle and concludes he may be able to behead him if he removes his battle spirit to avoid his senses
akaza begins to overwhelm giyu the latter having used all his water breathing forms only for akaza to immediately adapt to them all and anticipate what he uses
the upper moon decides to finally kill him commending the hashira for lasting this long in battle
as tanjiro attempts to enter the selfless state giyu tries to strike the demons head directly
akaza responds by dodging the blow then using the side of his fist to break giyus nichirin sword without getting harmed
as giyu becomes stunned at having his sword broken akaza farewells him before crouching down and going in to punch through his stomach
suddenly akazas hand falls off saving giyu from getting hit tanjiro has managed to enter the selfless state and bypass akazas compass needle
as giyu looks on at tanjiros new appearance and power akazas body becomes stricken with uncertainty at tanjiros changed aura
he deploys his final form technique deployment final form blue silver chaotic afterglow
giyu looks at this new threat and is uncertain if he can negate this with his own dead calm
tanjiro however seeing into the transparen't world again is able to detect the attack with his increased perception and vision
giyu is unable to beat akazas new technique and is knocked back against the wall his water breathing eleventh form dead calm unable to handle the force
the demon commends for surviving such a large number of fatal blows and tells him don't die like kyojuro and tanjiro become a demon giyu
however the water hashira becomes confused wondering how akaza can state that he killed tanjiro with tanjiro standing behind him realizing maybe he is unable to sense his partner
he mutters to tanjiro to go for the neck now that akaza is unaware
tanjiro calls out to the upper moon and declares he will decapitate him annoying giyu for announcing his attack out loud
akaza retaliates by attempting to swipe the demon slayers head only for tanjiro to duck down to safety
akaza wonders how he is able to avoid his final form but assures himself that his compass needle will sense any attack with his battle spirit high
suddenly he notices he cannot sense anything seeing tanjiro as completely different from before and shocking him
with his battle spirit seemingly gone akaza tries to calm himself and believes he will be able to sense an attack
without warning his head is sliced off by tanjiro using the hinokami kagura setting sun transformation
with giyu stunned at tanjiros feat akaza declares this impossible unable to sense what happened

at the beginning of the story however a 16yearold genius girl named bulma invents a dragon radar to detect the dragon balls and makes the process far easier than it was originally intended to be
the story of dragon ball unfolds gradually over 11 years of publication
the tone and the style of the stories gradually changes to reflect the tastes of the readers and the editors of shōnen jump in japan
the early volumes of the manga are primarily humorous fantasy stories but they contain some minor scifi elements much like dr
notable fantasy elements include not only the monkey boy goku and the dragon balls themselves but also many talking animal characters unlikely martial art techniques and identifying characters as gods and demons
despite the fantasy elements the world does contain highly advanced technology including hoipoi capsules spacesaving capsules which are pocket sized but can store almost any object and other near future
the overall mood of the earlier volumes is light with few deaths and an emphasis on adventure and humor
a subtle but significan't change in mood begins after gokus best friend krillin is killed 
this begins the king piccolo arc in which the manga enters a darker tone compared to it's earlier volumes
this arc would more or less define how later arcs would be structured
dragon ball fully transforms into an action based shōnen manga at the onset of the saiyan arc 
starting with introduction of gokus first son things begin to take a much more serious and harder scifi approach
many characters which were previously implied to have mystic origins including goku and piccolo are revealed to be aliens from other planets
advanced space travel alien threats and powerful cyborgs and androids take center stage instead of more fantastic villains
super saiyan goku as seen in the manga 
after the defeat of vegeta and the conclusion of the saiyan arc the survivors of the vicious saiyan attack head off to the planet namek to resurrect their friends
this begins the frieza arc 
the frieza arc is noteworthy for introducing the first super saiyan now a staple of the series
it also sets the tone for more awesomely powerful characters
for example the antagonist frieza is first said to have a power level
he then transforms into a more powerful form at which point his power level is over 1000000
after two subsequent transformations he reveals that he is still only using a fraction of his full power
the android arc introduces future trunks a mysterious halfsaiyan halfhuman from a destroyed future world where all of the z fighters are killed by evil seemingly unstoppable war machines called androids and the enigmatic and villainous cell who is made from the cells from most of the heroes as well as some of the villains
this arc is notable for being the only arc in which goku does not defeat the main villain instead it is his son gohan who defeats cell
in this arc gohan surpasses the level of super saiyan and reaches the stage of super saiyan 2 in order to defeat cell
after gokus death he is allowed to keep his body and train in the other world
seven years pass and goku gets stronger while gohans power decreases
fortuneteller baba allows goku to return to earth for a single day which marks the start of the majin buu arc which is the final arc of the manga
the beginning of this final arc concentrates on a teenaged gohan
all the male saiyans manage to reach the level of super saiyan at least 
gohan can still use super saiyan 2 while goku and vegeta obtain this transformation as well
and the final level of the super saiyans super saiyan 3 is reached by goku and later gotenks
a considerable number of fusions also take place to add to the series allowing goten and trunks to fuse resulting in gotenks goku and vegeta fuse to create the single most powerful character in dragon ball the invincible vegito
during this series majin buu destroys earth and even manages to increase his own power by absorbing gotenks piccolo and gohan
majin buu also succeeds where the villains vegeta frieza and cell had previously failed and destroys earth
earth and everyone that was on it when it was destroyed are restored using the namekian dragon balls and kid buu is destroyed by gokus spirit bomb only after taking on goku vegeta mr
satan and good buu
kid buu was reincarnated into a human being of pure good called uub and goku vegeta mr
satan and the good buu return to earth and returned to earth to reunite with their friends and families
ten years later goku asks good buu to cheat so goku and uub can have a match after the match goku decides to go to uubs village and train uub to his potential so that one day they can have a match to decide who is the strongest fighter in the universe 
uubs village later receives money from mr
to say goodbye the heroes that appear in the manga everyone waves to the readers and a large the end
sign is seen floating
after completing this series toriyama had a break before making gag manga called nekomajin
this story features many elements and a few characters from dragon ball including characters such as majin buu vegeta and goku
a korean mmorpg that serves as a followup to the manga dragon ball online was developed with bandai namco games and ntl
the game acts as a sequel to the manga with akira toriyama having supervised all aspects of the game from storyline and setting to character and location designs
in a press conference in south korea on february 14 2008 kazuhiko torishima the director of shueisha at the time stated that toriyama had immersed himself in creating character designs and providing editorial supervision for the game for the past five years
two of the main villains of the game mira and towa were created by akira toriyama himself
dragon ball z battle of gods and dragon ball z resurrection ‘f’ have been said to be an expansion to the manga as well as the new arcs of dragon ball super due to toriyamas involvement in the production writing their respective scripts
with the fate of namek at stake grand elder guru sends the young namekian dende to give the important information to krillin and gohan about how summon porunga the namekian dragon
dende summons porunga the namekian dragon
as dende finally reaches krillin with the important message they take the dragon balls from a sleeping vegeta and head away from friezas spaceship
dende summons porunga by speaking the namekian language
meanwhile back on friezas ship vegeta awakens suddenly sensing friezas approaching power level and to see that the dragon has already been summoned
gohan krillin and dende set out to make their wish which is to revive yamcha tien shinhan chiaotzu and piccolo
the dragon informs them that he can only wish back one person at a time
with king kais help piccolo communicates telepathically to gohan and asks him to restore his life
his reasoning is that if he is resurrected kami will return to earth and that will also bring back earths dragon balls in effect allowing for the others to also be revived with a wish
piccolo asks for the second wish to teleport him to namek wanting to exact revenge on frieza for killing his people despite king kai’s objections
gohan krillin and dende agree to this and make the wishes
frieza prepares to transform
vegeta arrives at the scene after the second wish is made
since the first two wishes had already been used to bring piccolo back to life and then to namek vegeta wants to save the last wish for eternal life for himself
just as dende asks the dragon guru dies and the dragon balls turn to stone
vegetas wish is not granted but worse yet frieza has arrived and is extremely angry that the dragon balls have already been used
vegeta fights his former boss gloating that he has become a super saiyan but as frieza shockingly realizes they are somewhat evenly matched vegeta abruptly tells him to transform and reveal his true strength
frieza amusingly wonders how vegeta knows this and vegeta tells him zarbon spilled it out before
frieza transforms into his second form one that is even stronger than before claiming that his power level has risen over a million
frieza tells them that while most transform to increase their battle power he does it to decrease his power because it is so enormous it's hard to control himself
vegeta realizing that he underestimated friezas strength is shocked
meanwhile piccolo who was just teleported to namek by a wish senses the fighting and heads to the battlefield
along the way he sees the dying nail who informs him on what has been happening
he also requests that piccolo fuse with him to be more of a challenge to frieza
at first piccolo is reluctant but after nail assures him that his personality will not change by fusing piccolo decides to accept increasing his strength and speed tremendously
frieza grabs gohan by the hair 5
frieza defeats gohan with ease
back on the battlefield friezas new power level is said by him to be over one million
he also tells vegeta about the destruction of the planet vegeta and his father
vegeta simply scoffs at this saying that he surpassed his father when he was a child
after fully transforming he impales krillin with his horns who was trying to protect dende and tosses him to the sea
gohan tries to save him but when frieza stops him an incredibly angry gohan easily beats down frieza and pummels him with many ki blasts
despite vegetas shocked reaction the attack is not enough and frieza recovers with little damage done
luckily dende rescued krillin out of the sea telling gohan that he is still alive
angry that he was actually was hurt by the attack frieza then easily pounds gohan hurting him severely
vegeta tries to attack when friezas back is turned but it is completely ineffective and gohan is left almost dead
gohan is saved when krillin launches a destructo disc at frieza and cuts off his tail
dende then uses this time to heal gohan as vegeta watches
it was revealed that dende was the one who plucked krillin out of the sea and healed him
krillin continues to distract frieza using many evasive maneuvers such as solar flare
soon gohan is healed and now stronger than ever due to his saiyan genes
piccolo takes on frieza
just then piccolo arrives claiming that he can beat frieza
vegeta scoffs at piccolo claiming that reviving him was a waste of a wish
however this turns to shock for vegeta that the namekian who was easily killed by nappa had now become powerful enough to challenge frieza
the fight begins as piccolo remains confident that he can take frieza down
thanks to his fusion with nail his power is slightly higher than that of friezas
through much of the battle piccolo has the upper hand but frieza transforms again into his third stage earning yet another power increase
frieza fires an array of blasts
piccolo still confident that his speed is greater than friezas is quickly proved wrong when frieza grossly outstrips him in both power and speed and subsequently launches finger blasts at him that are too fast for him to dodge as he is unable to even see the blasts
soon piccolo is severely wounded and helpless against frieza
gohan furious at the torture that piccolo is receiving explodes in a bout of rage revealing his hidden powers as he once again takes on frieza
krillin blasts a hole through vegeta
gohan then launches a wild rush blaster that proves to be challenging for frieza until he deflects it back
luckily piccolo saves gohan in the nick of time with a blast
frieza realizes that gohan is a saiyan and that he and vegeta are constantly getting stronger
he then decides to transform into his final and strongest form his original being
vegeta comes up with the idea for krillin to blast him to near death and for dende to heal him afterwards increasing his power enough to become a super saiyan
although krillin is highly reluctant at first he blasts vegeta in the stomach piercing him through
because of saiyan heritage recovery from a neardeath experience causes vegeta to increase in strength significan'tly
while frieza transforms dende heals piccolo and reluctantly heals vegeta
vegeta becomes confident that he has become a super saiyan
another transformation frieza fighters
frieza in his final form
frieza sees how everyone was defying death using dendes healing so he takes to the root of the problem
after transforming he quickly kills dende with a death beam meaning the fighters will have no more chances to be healed
he tries to blast gohan as well but vegeta quickly saves him
a confident vegeta decides to commence battle with frieza and his newfound power
to his horror no matter what vegeta does he is no match and frieza still has the upper hand throughout the whole battle
vegeta actually sheds a tear in frustration when he realizes that the situation is hopeless
because he drops all his defenses in desperation frieza batters him mercilessly to the brink of death
vegeta meets his end at the hands of frieza
goku still in the medical machine awakens and realizes what is taking place and quickly rushes off to save his comrades
as goku arrives vegeta swallows his pride and tells frieza that goku is the legendary super saiyan that will kill him
frieza gets angry and blasts a hole using his death beam through vegetas heart
before his death with tears in his eyes he tells goku the truth of planet vegetas destruction how every saiyan was forced to serve frieza before most of them were killed how frieza took vegeta from his father when he was a child and threaten to kill him unless he followed orders how frieza killed the king anyway along with gokus paren'ts and the saiyan race
in his last breath vegeta asks goku to take vengeance for all saiyans and goku then buries vegeta
fueled with rage at vegetas death goku honors vegetas request to take vengeance for planet vegeta and the entire saiyan race and begins to fight frieza
goku uses the kaioken x20
the battle between frieza and goku begins
they seem perfectly equivalent for some time in terms of strength and speed
during the match goku seems to have more clever ideas on how to fight and tricks frieza several times
goku used to his advantage the fact that frieza needs to see his opponent and is unable to feel their energy
while goku was under water during one attack he used the kamehameha wave as torpedoes to trick frieza
frieza then revealed that he was only using about a fraction of his power and that hell power up to 50 which turns the tables in friezas favor
at kaioken x10 goku was being brutally beaten
frieza claimed he allowed goku to think he had a chance and even offered for goku to replace ginyu as his bodyguard
goku refused but after one rigorous attack after another piccolo gohan krillin and even king kai began to see the situation as hopeless
goku tries to raise his power using the kaioken x20 and shoot a kaioken kamehameha at frieza but it only leaves friezas hands burnt while the attack left goku completely drained
goku endures friezas wrath
having no choice goku prepares the spirit bomb in desperation
piccolo gohan and krillin step in to try and hold off frieza while goku gathers energy for the attack
once the spirit bomb is finally finished and unleashed upon frieza it does significan't damage to him causing the z warriors to believe frieza was finished off
krillin and gohan take goku and piccolo away from the damage
a few minutes of celebration was soon turned into a horrid sight once krillin saw frieza furiously standing on the top of a rock
goku transforms into a super saiyan after witnessing krillins murder at the hands of frieza
enraged and surprised that goku had such ability for a saiyan frieza lashes out against the other warriors
he first decides to kill goku
as he fires a death beam at the exhausted saiyan piccolo jumps in the way of the blast and saves his life 
though it does not kill him piccolo is hurt very badly and falls to the ground unconscious enraging goku
next frieza kills krillin by making his whole body explode in the air
seeing his best friend killed causes goku to erupt with even more rage
in a display of gathering energy the angry goku pulls out his strongest emotions ever before reached
his hair turns spikier and golden and his eyes turn dark green
he is now a super saiyan a legendary class of saiyan with his power tremendously increased
he tells gohan to take piccolo and retrieve bulma and take them to the ship that he traveled in and use it to head back to earth and get as far from namek as possible
goku double axe handles frieza
super saiyan goku and frieza begin to fight and goku toys with him and starts treating him as if he was a rag doll
with no other options frieza decides that if he cannot beat goku then hell blow up namek instead
he throws a ball of energy towards the planets core hoping to destroy the planet
however frieza realizes he held back too much power and the planet only begins to crumble
frieza then claims it will explode in a few minutes and reveals that he can breathe in space
as the battle rages on frieza decides to use 100 of his full power
though this significan'tly increases his power level and allows frieza to gain the upper hand on goku for a time the damaged incurred in these previous levels causes him to lose that power radically after a short bout
goku realizes this and uses it to his advantage to take down the mighty tyrant
back on earth kami and mr
popo gathered all of the dragon balls which joys the z fighters at king kais place as it means piccolo is alive and with king kais help they devise a plan to bring back all who were killed by frieza and his army
vegeta laughs upon seeing the super saiyan
since the wish brings back guru who was killed by the grief of friezas killings king kai telepathically asks him to wish all of those on namek except for frieza back to earth with porunga who still has one wish remaining
however goku intercepts their telepathic communication and requests that he be left behind on namek as well to ensure friezas truly destroyed and king kai and guru reluctantly give in
king kai notices that super saiyan goku is no longer the goku they used to know he is now only acting on blind saiyan instincts
vegeta who was also resurrected as well by the wish is surprised to see that goku had become a super saiyan just before he is teleported off of namek
frieza is sliced by his own attack
with the entire planet empty except goku and frieza they take the battle around the crumbling planet
soon goku notices that frieza is losing stamina too much to be a match for him
he then stops that fight and begins to leave telling frieza to train and come back for a rematch
enraged frieza decides to release a death saucer that he can direct to attack goku with
goku easily outmaneuvers this attack
frieza realizes that one is not enough and releases another death disc attempting to outsmart goku
goku maneuvers at the last minute blasting into the ground creating a blinding blanket of dust
frieza is unable to detect energy without physically seeing it so one makes it's way to cut frieza in half
goku tries to warn him but he is chopped into four pieces by the disc
as he is dying frieza begs goku not to leave him like this
goku cannot stand seeing a life even one as evil as friezas suffer in such a painful and humiliating manner
eventually goku takes pity on the pathetic tyrant and gave him some of his energy
frieza then explains that there is no way goku is going to live as the planet is about to explode and his ship is in no working condition
as goku leaves frieza makes one final attempt to kill him using the energy given to him to throw a wave of energy at him
goku pushes the blast back at frieza with his own energy blast and flies away
knowing he will not reach his own ship in time goku searches for friezas and finds it in a crater
goku frustrated and desperate realizes that he will not make it off of namek as he watches it's wreckage plummet into a lava filled chasm
seconds later goku screams in agony and rage as planet namek disappears from the universe in a colossal blinding explosion
yamcha relays the news to bulma about what happened on namek
on earth dende heals piccolo and realizes that he has merged with nail
the namekian dragon balls follows guru to earth evading the explosion
as guru is dying once more he transfers his role as senior elder to moori a trusted namekian village leader so the dragon balls will not die with him leading to a tearful and emotional goodbye
dende also informs gohan that the namekian dragon balls can also resurrect a deceased person more than once
this is good news since it would mean that they could resurrect krillin chiaotzu and goku who had been killed before
everyone is thrilled until king kai reminds them that krillin and goku cannot be resurrected because the planet they died on was destroyed and if wished back they would only appear in empty space and immediately die again from lack of air
however vegeta suggests that they use a wish to transport their remains to earth first
130 days later the namekian dragon balls are able to be used again
they are first used to transport goku and krillins remains to earth
however porunga reveals that he is unable to transport gokus remains because he is not actually dead
after the second wish is used to bring back krillin the final wish is made to bring goku to earth but porunga then informs them that goku refuses to come back and will return later by himself
master roshi thinks that goku is afraid of seeing chichi again and chichi brings out a sword making roshi nervous
this leaves our heroes greatly perplexed but arrive at the conclusion that goku is coming home either way and they accept his absence
all that is except vegeta who leaves in a spaceship to search the universe for goku and the key to becoming a super saiyan
with one wish remaining it is used to resurrect yamcha
another 130 days later the namekian dragon balls are ready again
the first two wishes are to resurrect tien and chiaotzu and the final wish is to transport the nameks to a new namek that would have similar living conditions to their old planet namek
gohan and dende share a tearful goodbye as the nameks disappear to their new home gohan returns to his studies under his mother while piccolo promises to aid gohan in times of need
and life on earth returns to normal
the narrator ends the saga by stating that gokus family and friends gazes stars each night hoping for gokus arrival
the plot of the androids saga is closely tied to that of dragon ball the anime series that preceded dragon ball z
an organization known as the red ribbon army seeks to obtain the dragon balls
the main hero of the series goku is still a child in dragon ball and embarks upon a quest to find the dragon balls himself
this leads to conflict between the red ribbon army and goku
as part of their plan to collect the dragon balls the red ribbon army employs dr
gero as their head scientist
gero proceeds to construct a series of powerful androids
although only in the dragon ball anime version dr
flappe is presented as the androids creator he is later revealed to be only the cocreator of android 8
goku is eventually forced to destroy the red ribbon organization in order to protect the dragon balls inciting dr
gero to seek revenge upon him
gero goes unmentioned in dragon ball and dragon ball z until the trunks saga in which the titular character future trunks warns goku that dr
gero survived the attacks to red ribbon when goku was a child and has created a new set of androids intent upon destroying the earth
future trunks also reveals that goku will die from an incurable heart disease before he has the chance to confront the androids
future trunks then presents goku with medicine from the future that will cure his otherwise fatal disease
he also mentions that future vegeta and future bulma are his paren'ts which shocks goku
piccolo hears the conversation between goku and future trunks due to his exceptional ears
after delivering his doomsday warnings future trunks returns to his own future in a time machine and the dragon team begin three years of training for the upcoming battle against the androids
battle with android 19 and android 20
android 19 and android 20 
three years after future trunks had warned goku about the androids arrival the z fighters go to the city where future trunks told them the androids would appear sasebo
goku gohan and piccolo meet krillin halfway to sasebo and they see the differences in their powers
on an island nearby they meet up with yamcha tien shinhan and bulma who is carrying a baby
goku tells her to leave for her own safety but she says she wants to see the androids and then will leave
krillin asks about the baby and gohan assumes it is yamchas
yamcha says that he is not the father
goku says that vegeta is the father and the babys name is trunks much to krillin and gohans surprise
bulma asks how he knew because she has not told anyone yet but he laughs it off
piccolo asks where vegeta is
bulma does not know because they are not living together but says he has been training intensely for this day
they have thirty minutes to spare so krillin and gohan entertain trunks
when 1000 comes and goes the z fighters are suspicious
gohan says that androids do not have a ki so they cannot sense them
yajirobe arrives with senzu beans from korin and leaves after refusing to fight
seconds later yajirobes hovercar explodes
the z fighters spot two figures lurking in the smoke from the blast
the figures race down into the city so fast that none of the fighters can see what they look like
as the z fighters cannot sense the androids ki they split up and go down into the city to find them
yamcha makes his way to one of the lower cities where he encounters the androids
the androids resemble people so they go undetected by yamcha
android 20 reveals himself as an android by grabbing yamcha by the mouth and draining the majority of his energy
there are two of them android 19 and android 20
as yamcha struggles android 20 punches him through his chest severely wounding him
android 20 destroys most of the island
goku and the others who sense yamchas life force disappearing arrive shortly after finding the androids and yamcha who is laying on the ground dying
goku asks krillin to evacuate yamcha and get him a senzu bean before it is too late
the androids are eager to fight but goku tells them that there are too many innocent people around
android 20 decides to fix
the problem by using his eye lasers to destroy every living thing nearby
this infuriates goku who then throws a punch at android 20
android 20 seems unaffected by the impact
goku and the others convince the androids to move away from the city in order to fight without harming anymore innocent bystanders
after yamcha is completely healed with a senzu bean he follows krillin and gohan to find the others
android 19 dodges gokus punch
they come to a deserted rocky area and goku offers to fight first
however goku is clearly not his usual confident self as he appears to already be tired and out of breath just from flying to this location
it becomes apparen't that goku is experiencing some mild effects from the heart virus which take it's toll six months later than future trunks had predicted
regardless he decides to fight android 19 and transforms into a super saiyan
android 20 is surprised by this transformation because while he spied on gokus battle with vegeta and earlier he did not observe the battles that took place on namek including the colossal battle between goku and frieza in which goku achieved super saiyan for the first time
however android 20 unaware of the extraordinary powers of super saiyans claims it is just a minor setback
and believes that android 19 will still be able to defeat goku
he then seems to be proven wrong when goku and android 19 engage in battle as gokus super saiyan strength and speed is superior to that of android 19
goku seems to have the upper hand during the beginning of the battle
meanwhile the z fighters watch the fight from below
krillin tien and yamcha cheer goku on believing that he will easily win against the android
however gohan and piccolo sense that something is wrong and they notice that something is taking away from gokus energy
he increasingly becomes more tired and out of breath greatly lacking the power and energy of his usual self
piccolo shot by gero
piccolo shot in the chest by android 20
the fight continues and gokus condition rapidly deteriorates as his punches and kicks seem to have little effect on android 19
goku struggles to create a kamehameha which android 19 absorbs with his hand
piccolo then warns goku not to use any energy blasts against the androids
goku gets weaker by the minute and expresses that he feels like he is dying
he clutches his hand to his chest and at this point gohan realizes that the heart virus is attacking him
krillin then gives goku a senzu bean but it has no effect against the virus and gokus condition continues to worsen
android 19 takes advantage of this apparen't weakness hitting goku with several kicks and punches before knocking him to the floor
android 19 then sit's on top of goku wrapping his hand around gokus neck in order to drain him of his energy
the z fighters try to help him but android 20 blocks their path
goku lays dying as his energy is drained by the android until vegeta makes his appearance on the battlefield and interferes blindsiding android 19 with a powerful kick to the face
vegeta scolds goku for fighting in his condition and kicks him towards piccolo and the others
the z fighters decide that yamcha should take goku home while vegeta takes over the fight
android 19 struggles against super saiyan vegeta
vegeta surprises everyone when he reveals his newfound ability to turn super saiyan like goku vegetas eyes turn green and his hair turn a golden yellow
however confident after defeating super saiyan goku android 19 believes that he can easily defeat vegeta claiming that he already knows all of his moves
however vegeta laughs at these claims mocking the fact that dr
gero did not observe the battles that took place on namek 
vegeta then toys with android 19 allowing the android to punch him in the face so that he can laugh at how weak the android is
vegeta then proves himself superior to the android in both strength and speed
he easily overpowers android 19 until the android catches him off guard wrapping his hands around vegetas wrists
he begins to drain vegetas energy but vegeta remains smiling and confident placing his feet against the androids head and forcing it back while pulling his arms
android 19 is able to absorb a substantial amount of energy until vegeta rips his arms off
the android then runs away in fear and vegeta blasts him with a big bang attack which destroys him easily
after the destruction of android 19 vegeta is naturally quite drained but bluffs android 20 into thinking he is still capable of taking him out
android 20 seeing the death of android 19 as proof easily takes the bait and is scared off
vegeta eats a senzu bean and chases after him
piccolo battles android 20 severing his energyabsorption right arm
android 20 distracts vegeta and promptly flees the battle
hiding out in various canyons and behind rock faces android 20 is stalked by the relentlessly pursuing z fighters at a range of canyons
however they struggle to find him as they are unable to sense the power levels of androids
android 20 hides while vegeta becoming more and more frustrated throws a ki blast into the canyon hoping to clear it away
this works to android 20s advantage as he reveals himself to absorb the ki blast and then flees once more
android 20 then plans to absorb the energy of all the weaker fighters in order to power himself up and beat vegeta
he deduces that piccolo is the strongest next to vegeta and sneaks up on him from behind
he holds him in his grasp with his hand over piccolos mouth draining his energy
piccolo alerts gohan telepathically and gohan hit's android 20 with a double axe handle removing him from piccolos back
piccolo then eats a senzu bean and challenges android 20 to a fight
he gains the upper hand of the fight beating android 20 with several powerful blows and ripping the androids arm off so that he cannot absorb any more energy
at that point android 20 realizes that even with his newly absorbed energy he still is not strong enough to defeat piccolo someone who should be nothing compared to him according to his data
piccolo informs him that they had all been training for their arrival for the past three years
this comes as a surprise to android 20 and he knows that he must return to his laboratory to repair himself in order to survive
android 20s photon wave hit's bulmas plane
future trunks then arrives and is shocked to discover that androids 19 and 20 are not the same androids from the future that he warned the z fighters about three years ago
naturally this surprises everyone
piccolo calls trunks by his name and it is at this point that vegeta realizes the boy from the future is in fact his sons future self
vegeta also understands how future trunks was able to become a super saiyan even though there were only three saiyans left in existence 
bulma yajirobe and baby trunks then arrive in an aircraft and bulma notices android 20
while everyones attention is diverted to bulma android 20 takes the opportunity to escape but not before claiming that he will now proceed to activate two more androids 17 and 18
he then blows up the landscape with a powerful photon wave which further distracts everyone
bulma panics wondering where her infant child is
bulmas aircraft is blown up but she and baby trunks are saved by future trunks
future trunks is angry that vegeta the one closest to them did not seem to notice nor care about the lifethreatening danger bulma and the baby were subjected to
future trunks then confronts his father demanding to know why he did not try to save bulma and his son
vegeta spitefully replies i have more important things to worry about than that foolish woman and her blasted child
and continues to look around for the android angry that he was able to disappear from sight again
when he is unable to find him vegeta goes back to the group
bulma retaliates at vegeta for being uncaring when she says that he makes trunks cry every time he sticks his geeky face
up to him much to krillin and gohans amusement
bulma then recalls seeing dr
geros picture in one of her fathers science magazines revealing that android 20 is actually dr
gero and that he rebuilt himself into an android as his human body became older and weak
bulma also remembers reading about the location of dr
geros laboratory just north of north city
the z fighters then plot to find the lab and destroy it before dr
gero can activate the other two androids
however vegeta says that that is a cowardly move proudly claiming that they should allow the androids to be activated so that he can defeat them all by himself
future trunks warns vegeta to never underestimate the power of the androids but vegeta refuses to listen and flies off
future trunks chases after him to prevent his father from suffering his predicted death
after hearing him call vegeta father gohan and krillin are confused so piccolo reveals that future trunks is the person the baby will grow up to be
while gohan and krillin are shocked bulma is only relieved that trunks will not look like vegeta as an adult
gero with androids 17 and 18 after he awakened them from their chambers
the z fighters then pursue dr
gero to his lab but arrive too late as he has already activated his most recent yet unstable creations the lethal siblings android 17 and android 18
future trunks wants to destroy them before they are activated having already seen the damage that the two androids future counterparts have done in his timeline
however much to his dismay vegeta says wants to fight them as they might be a good challenge to him
gero knows of their inability to follow orders directly and had built an emergency shut down remote to subdue the androids whenever they become out of control
however since the androids are so powerful and wise they easily snatch the remote from him
they make their way to another one of dr
geros creations and decide to unleash this incomplete monster going by the name android 16
gero is furious and yells at them with increasing intensity to not activate android 16 as it's awakening might kill them all
android 17 and android 18 do not listen to him and android 17 betrays and effortlessly kills dr
at this point in his super saiyan form future trunks snaps and launches a full power buster cannon at the androids destroying the whole lab and the surrounding mountainside
this does not faze them at all and android 17 and android 18 then awaken android 16 who states that his main purpose is to kill goku
battle with android 17 and android 18
android 18 faces vegeta
androids 16 17 and 18 leave the site of dr
geros lab in order to begin their search for goku
the z fighters concede that they will be easily overpowered by the androids except for vegeta who is eager to test his strength against them
vegeta is confident that being a super saiyan the androids will be no match for him
future trunks warns him once again not to underestimate the androids demanding that they should all wait until goku gets better before confronting them
however vegeta is angered by this suggestion punching future trunks in the stomach
he then takes off to find the androids by himself
meanwhile the three androids stop at a mountainside road and wait for a car to pass by so that they can steal it in order to have some fun during their search for goku android 16 remains quiet at first responding only when goku is mentioned
peculiarly he stands like a statue at the edge of the road observing nature and the birds
when vegeta arrives android 17 suggests that android 16 should test out his strength against him but 16 refuses claiming that he will fight no one but goku as he was programmed to do
vegeta stands confidently boasting his strength and challenging to send the androids back to the scrap heap
android 18 becomes annoyed by vegeta claiming that he talks too much and they begin to fight
android 18 breaks vegetas arm
at first it seems that android 18 is no match for vegeta which shocks future trunks and the z fighters but it soon becomes apparen't that android 18 is only toying with him
however not being one to give up vegeta continues to fight and get beaten thinking that he could tire her out
it becomes evident that these two androids in fact do not tire out or run out of energy as they were built with almost unlimited internal power sources
eventually android 18 ends the battle by breaking vegetas arm with a kick
android 17 comes and tells the z fighters that no one should interfere in the match or he will fight them as well
regardless future trunks jumps in to help his beaten father but is taken out with one hit from android 17
the others having no choice rush them as well only to be taken out without effort
vegetas determination does not pull through when android 18 breaks his other arm finally rendering him unconscious
this leaves only krillin who did not fight due to fear unscathed
android 18 kisses a terrified krillin
krillin tries to reason with the androids that goku had done nothing to them and that going after him would be morally wrong
android 17 then explains to krillin that finding goku is a game
android 16 also says that he was programmed to kill goku
then android 16 and android 17 go off to find goku but not before telling krillin that if anyone else wants to face them again they would gladly accept a rematch
android 18 then kisses krillin and they fly off
krillin wonders if the androids are as evil as future trunks warned but puts that aside and quickly heals the others with the remaining senzu beans
vegeta gets back to his feet and dusts himself off
his pride keeping him from admitting his inferior power he flies off angrily
future trunks realizes that the androids in the time period are far stronger than their counterparts in his own time as he was able to fight them evenly for a time there
piccolo comes to a realization that they do not have enough time to train and the only way for him to get strong enough is to become one being with kami
he does not admit any of this to the others though and tries to fool them into thinking he is still the evil king piccolo by making idle threats and then flying off
krillin is not fooled though and instantly makes the realization that piccolo is going to the lookout to fuse with him
he would then become one with kami as they used to be long ago
piccolo arrives at the lookout demanding that they fuse together so that he will have the power to defeat the androids
at first kami is unsure about the fusion and piccolo becomes angry
he proceeds to sit down waiting for kami to make his decision
a short amount of time passes and kami notices that earth is now being threatened by an even greater force than the androids
he has known about the existence of this threat for the past four years and it has now emerged terrorizing thousands of people
kami then agrees to fuse with piccolo and they remain using piccolos body
nevertheless they rejoin and regain the identity that they had lost long ago as well as kamis vast wisdom and knowledge becoming a super namek
because of the fusion the dragon balls and shenron cease to exist
this is a problem that is later solved
with the knowledge of the new creature piccolo goes to investigate the threat
trunks and gohan come back to kame house
krillin calls capsule corporation to tell bulma that they are moving goku to kame house and bulma tells them of a shocking discovery another time machine that looks like the same one future trunks came in
future trunks is shocked because there is only one time machine in existence which is the one he has in his pocket as a capsule
she faxes over a picture of the other time machine and future trunks and gohan go meet her to examine it
when they get to the place where the picture was taken future trunks confirms that it was his machine
however it looked aged with moss and had damage to the dome damage showing that someone or something blasted it's way out
soon gohan discovers an exoskeleton of some disgusting looking creature and bulma finds eggshells
soon all the z fighters sense strange and familiar power levels from far away
also there is a news report depicting that a local suburban district gingertowns population of 15000 that completely vanished
all that was revealed was scattered clothing about everywhere and signs of a struggle
imperfect cell shows himself
the source of the power levels future trunks aged time machine and the disappearances finally reveals himself as a hideous humanoid creature with insect qualities
the creature explains how the people of gingertown all disappeared by sucking the bio matter of a human with his unique tail reducing him to nothing in front of piccolos eyes
piccolo instantly confronts him and they fight
meanwhile android 16 detects two enormous powers fighting with his power radar and tells the other two that one of the powers is equal to android 17 himself
android 17 bluffs this and believes that android 16s power radar is broken and they drive off foreshadowing things to come
piccolos strength is clear in this fight he completely dominates the creature but is stunned with surprise when it shoots a kamehameha wave at him
distracted piccolos arm is absorbed into a sagging mound of flesh and he admit's defeat while asking it who it is and how it made it here
the monster then goes on to reveal that it's name was cell and how he was created by dr
gero as the perfect fighting android made up of the cells of the universes strongest warriors
gero saw the plan to create the ultimate bio soldier was taking too long so he abandoned the project
instead the supercomputer in charge of the project continued the project secretly
a special robot was created to capture the gene samples of goku vegeta and piccolo when they were fighting on earth frieza and king colds genes were captured when they came to earth and were killed by future trunks
many others fell into that category too and that he had learned many of their strongest techniques and abilities
future trunks genes were not collected though as enough saiyan samples were collected
however imperfect cell reveals his most disturbing fact that his true purpose was to absorb the unique infinite power cores of android 17 and android 18 reaching his perfect form
with the earths population low in his future and android 17 and android 18 destroyed imperfect cell decided to steal future trunks time machine by killing another version of future trunks and come back to this time to a fresher planet with more victims
cell believes that it's time to end the fight as piccolo thinks he has enough information and reveals that he was bluffing the whole time by regenerating his arm back
cell is angry at being tricked as piccolo vows to stop him
cell uses the solar flare to escape
despite imperfect cell absorbing a lot of energy from piccolos arm he realizes that he is no match for piccolo at all and it is only made worse when future trunks and krillin arrive as well
imperfect cell recognizes future trunks as the boy he killed in his own timeline and realizes that this future trunks must be from another alternate timeline
he also learns from krillin that goku is still alive as well and uses his solar flare technique to blind everyone and runs away masking his power to be as undetectable by the others
just then cell notices vegeta who sensing a great ki travels to gingertown and is shocked when it comes from piccolo
he is updated on how the namekian got stronger
tien arrives shortly after as piccolo explains the situation of cell to vegeta and the others who all have unique reactions trunks is shocked by another android krillin is dismayed at the threat he poses and vegeta is angry that everything is surpassing him the saiyan prince
vegeta then vows to surpass the limit's of super saiyan and flies off
future trunks and krillin leave to destroy the imperfect cell that is probably growing in this timeline to prevent another imperfect cell later
meanwhile piccolo and tien search desperately for imperfect cell knowing that he has hidden his ki and is ever getting stronger by absorbing more victims
back in the mountain region the androids are joyriding their way to gokus house
goku is then moved to master roshis house
the androids reach gokus home and find that it is completely empty so they proceed to the next likely place for him to be kame house
future trunks destroys dr
future trunks and krillin return to the site of dr
geros laboratory this time discovering a secret laboratory hidden underground
here they find the cell of the present in his larvalbaby form infantile and weak his growth and development maintained only by the master computer
they also discover dr
geros blueprints which outline the design of android 17
future trunks eager to take the opportunity to find any weakness of the androids takes the blueprints before he and krillin incinerate the baby cell and the supercomputer with ki blasts
krillin then destroys the laboratory they were in
future trunks instructs krillin to bring the blueprints to bulma at capsule corporation so that she can examine them as he plans to go looking for his father vegeta in order to train with him and learn to become an ascended saiyan as well
however krillin warns future trunks that vegeta is very independent and may prefer to train alone
meanwhile cell is ravaging through cities depleting the population as he absorbs energy from every human he can find in order to become stronger
piccolo krillin and tien continue to search for cell but he remains one step ahead of them hiding in the shadows as he knows that he is not yet powerful enough to defeat piccolo
the saiyans on the lookout
back at kame house goku has been resting in the upstairs bedroom as the antidote slowly cures him of the heart virus
at one point chichi goes to check up on goku and discovers his bed empty
she looks out the window and finds goku healthy and fully restored testing his ki blasts across the ocean
goku and the others exchange heartfelt greetings that he is fully awake again and goku explains that he overheard everyone talking about the situation while he was asleep
he then says his goodbyes and uses instant transmission to teleport to the aircraft where the z fighters are
after everyone is happy that gokus well again goku himself states that in his current state he is no match for either the androids or imperfect cell
because of this he plans to enter the hyperbolic time chamber with gohan where they can spend a whole year training in the span of one day in real time in order to surpass the powers of a super saiyan
goku and gohan then proceed to find future trunks and vegeta in the mountains
future trunks tells goku that vegeta refuses to train with him and that he has been standing on a rock cliff for three days straight trying to figure out how to ascend passed the level of a super saiyan
goku approaches vegeta and tells him about the hyperbolic time chamber stating that only two people can enter the chamber at once
goku will be going in with gohan leaving vegeta to train with trunks
eager at the chance to complete a years worth of training in one day vegeta accepts the offer and demands to go first
the four of them then proceed to kamis lookout where mr
popo leads them to the hyperbolic time chamber
vegeta and future trunks enter the chamber first and goku and gohan wait outside the door for a day
the androids confront piccolo on an island nearby kame house
as future trunks and vegeta train in the hyperbolic time chamber piccolo is at the kame house watching the news and cursing imperfect cell while the others are taking a nap
however android 16 android 17 and android 18 suddenly arrive in front of kame house
piccolo is surprised to see them and awakens the others
the androids ask the z fighters where goku is but they refuse to tell
piccolo then challenges android 17 to a fight and they move to a deserted island nearby
piccolo requests that the other two androids stay out of the fight and android 17 agrees
however android 17 dosen't realize that piccolo has fused with kami 
because of this android 17 underestimates him and is knocked down easily at first
android 16 then warns android 17 that piccolo is much stronger than before
the battle becomes more serious as the two give it their all and are evenly matched in power with piccolo gaining a slight advantage with his new techniques
meanwhile imperfect cell still absorbing energy from humans in a nearby city notices piccolos huge ki and deduces that he must be fighting the androids
he then rushes full speed to them finally seeing a chance to absorb the androids and achieve his perfect form
after intense fighting android 17 states that piccolo won't be able to keep this up forever as he dosen't have infinite stamina
piccolo states that before that happens android 17 will make a mistake
piccolo headbutts android 17
at this point bulma has created a remote that will deactivate the androids based on dr
back at kamis lookout gohan and goku continue to wait outside of the hyperbolic time chamber growing impatient
they feel the massive energy of cell approaching piccolo and the androids worried that piccolo won't be able to hold them off for much longer
piccolo and android 17 continue to fight on the deserted islands
they both give it their all and are evenly matched
piccolo calls android 17 an early prototype
and android 17 defiantly replies i am the ultimate android there are no improvements to be made
 before the fighting can resume piccolo looks in horror at a nearby rock upon which cell is standing
the androids look in confusion to what is happening and piccolo and android 16 notice imperfect cells new incredible power from absorbing many thousands of people
imperfect cell soundly beats piccolo
immediately after imperfect cell interrupted the battle between android 17 and piccolo he began to inspect the other androids
he recognizes android 17 as being amazingly efficient
and android 18 as poetry in motion
imperfect cell stops short when he sees android 16 brushing him off as an earlier less efficient model
android 17 however does not recognize imperfect cell and asks him to stop interrupting the battle
meanwhile krillin flies off to meet bulma to retrieve the remote control and tien watches the battle between imperfect cell piccolo and the androids from a nearby rock
piccolo is shocked that the androids do not even know who imperfect cell is though intervenes to save them
the namek warns android 17 and android 18 that imperfect cell is another of geros creations and his purpose is to absorb them and be complete
imperfect cell takes this patiently and asks them to be merged with him to be the most powerful being that dr
android 17 refuses the offer and stands willing to fight imperfect cell
android 16 then warns 17 not to fight him because of his extreme power advising androids 17 and 18 to run away
however they are still skeptical towards imperfect cell and without realizing the seriousness of the threat he poses they choose to stay
imperfect cell powers up to an unparalleled power exploiting the thousands of lives he absorbed
he then beats android 17 to a pulp in order to weaken him and absorb him by force
piccolo tries to interfere but is easily overpowered
he launches his light grenade attack at imperfect cell but he is not fazed by it
imperfect cell then breaks piccolos neck with a strong punch and launches an energy wave through piccolos stomach tossing him into the sea
he does not immediately resurface and is presumed to be dead
gohan sensing that piccolos ki had disappeared goes on a rage and has to be held down by goku
android 16 fights imperfect cell
at this point android 16 finally decides to fight
he once again advises android 18 to leave and tells her that he enjoyed the time they spent together
coinciding with his tendency to peacefully observe nature android 16 expresses that the world is a good place and hed rather die than to live in fear
android 16 then interrupts imperfect cell as he attempts to absorb android 17 by punching him hard in the face and knocking him to the ground
android 17 questions how android 16 was able to do this and 16 tells him that according to his calculations his own power and strength is equal to that of imperfect cell
they begin to fight an even battle with android 16 having a slight upper hand
at onepoint imperfect cell strikes android 16 in the neck with the point of his tail and attempts to absorb him but his plan backfires as 16 is a completely mechanical model with a different design than the other androids
then android 16 rips off imperfect cells tail in order to put a stop to his absorbing capabilities claiming that he is now like a bee without a stinger
unfortunately imperfect cell is composed of the cells of piccolo therefore he can regenerate his own body parts and limbs
android 17 being absorbed by imperfect cell
however android 16 refuses to give up and unleashes some of his secret techniques
16 then throws him to the ground and launches a hells flash directly at imperfect cell which inflicts a huge amount of damage on imperfect cell but fails to kill him
android 17 seeing android 16s massive power gets incredibly cocky and plans to finish off imperfect cell himself despite android 16s repeated warnings to both androids 17 and 18 to run away
android 17 gets caught off guard and is finally absorbed by imperfect cell who was hiding underground behind him
the other two androids and tien watch in horror as android 17 is sucked into imperfect cells body as they are now all rendered powerless and can do nothing to stop the monstrous cell as begins his hideous transformation
semiperfect cell after absorbing android 17
cell is now in his semiperfect form and his first act is to test out his power
he does this by attacking android 16 with a blast that severely damages the android
by doing this he gets a taste of what his power can do and he has taken out the only thing preventing him from absorbing android 18
after android 18 refuses to join him he tries to persuade her by using android 17s voice saying that he enjoys being a part of semiperfect cell
she dosen't fall for his trick and finally threatens to detonate herself destructing bomb but semiperfect cell quickly informs her that while shes charging the blast semiperfect cell will have enough time to stop and absorb her
finally tien has had enough of just watching semiperfect cell torment others and decides to step in and try to stop semiperfect cell from absorbing 18
he manages to stall semiperfect cell with his new technique the neo tribeam while the androids find a place to hide
as androids 16 and 18 make their escape to an island in the distance tien shinhan is determined to hold off semiperfect cell for as long as he can by firing his neo tribeam
tien fires several in a row giving all the energy he has until he falls to the ground in a severely weakened condition
though they were able to buy some precious time the neo tribeams had little to no effect on the monstrous semiperfect cell
angry that android 18 was able to escape in the midst of the distraction semiperfect cell turns his sights to killing tien
meanwhile at the lookout goku and gohan sense what is going on below on earth
piccolo recovering after a vicious attack from imperfect cell
just as semiperfect cell is about to deliver the final blow to tien goku appears using instant transmission
the sudden appearance of goku catches semiperfect cell off guard as they share words in their official meeting
the saiyan promises to defeat cell after getting stronger
cell mocks goku for his supposed cowardice but is surprised goku is able to grab tien and also piccolo who washed up to shore barely clinging to life
goku teleports back to kamis lookout just as semiperfect cell makes a move to attack him
piccolo and tien are then given a senzu bean whilst semiperfect cell searches for android 18 in the neighboring islands
just as tien and piccolo recover they along with goku and gohan learn that vegeta and future trunks have completed their training and are ready to emerge from the hyperbolic time chamber
meanwhile bulma and baby trunks meet up with krillin while flying in her aircraft
bulma gives krillin a remote control that is capable of shutting down android 18 within a 10meter range
she then flies up to kamis lookout
future trunks after emerging from the time chamber
at the lookout future trunks and vegeta emerge from the hyperbolic time chamber after a year of intensive training 
it is apparen't that both of their powers have increased exponentially and they have reached a whole new level of strength
there is also a physical change in future trunks appearance his face has matured slightly he is now taller and more muscular than before and his hair has grown to be shoulderlength
bulma is surprised by the new length of future trunks hair and questions why vegetas hair did not grow as well
agitated vegeta informs her that a pureblooded saiyans hair does not grow or change once he or she is fully grown
just before vegeta and future trunks leave kamis lookout bulma provides everyone with new saiyan battle armor that is identical to vegetas
all of them accept the armor except for piccolo who is proud of his namekian heritage and tien who refuses to dress like vegeta
vegeta then rushes off to test his new power against semiperfect cell
before future trunks leaves goku gives him two senzu beans and bulma nervous about their wellbeing requests that future trunks takes care of himself as well as vegeta
goku tells gohan he must become a super saiyan
after scarfing down a meal prepared by mr
popo goku and gohan enter the hyperbolic time chamber with a clear mission to make gohan a super saiyan and to ascend to a level even greater than that of a super saiyan
gohan is surprised by the vast open space and gravity of the hyperbolic time chamber
goku instructs him to stay close at all times so that he does not get lost in the infinite space
goku then tells him that he is a stricter teacher than piccolo and that it is important for gohan to become even stronger than goku is
gohan though slightly overwhelmed and doubtful that he can obtain a power greater than his fathers is eager to begin training
through a series of powerful energy blasts semiperfect cell has depleted nearly every island in sight in his efforts to find android 18
only one island remains the very island that androids 16 and 18 are hiding upon and semiperfect cell raises his hand to blow it up as well
however vegeta arrives just in time to stop him with future trunks following closely behind
semiperfect cell unaware of their intensive training in the hyperbolic time chamber is unimpressed by the arrival of vegeta and future trunks believing that they will not present much of a challenge
vegeta proudly proclaims that he is now the strongest warrior in the universe and exhibit's his new strength by transforming into a super saiyan second grade
semiperfect cell is still not impressed as he believes that he is superior to vegeta no matter what transformation he goes through
he soon learns that he is no match for the saiyan prince
super vegeta delivers a heavy blow to cell
the battle begins with the newly ascended vegeta commanding complete control of the upper hand
whatever attacks semiperfect cell throws at him vegeta counters them all dominating in both strength and speed
as future trunks watches the battle he recalls the struggles he faced in the hyperbolic time chamber
while in the chamber vegeta refused any help from future trunks insisting that he only trains alone which made his feelings of indifference towards his son even more apparen't
however in spite of vegetas lack of caring future trunks still greatly yearns for his fathers approval expressing that i honored my fathers wishes to be left alone but i watched him from afar when i could and i learned
i knew that my father would achieve the greatness he desired he would climb any mountain that stood in his path and i vowed that i would follow in his footsteps
i would make my own ascension so that one day i might face my father as his equal and he will know that i am his son
father one day i will prove myself to you
maybe then youll understand that all of these dangers youre so eager to faceyou don't have to face them alone
android 18 notices krillin
while vegeta battles semiperfect cell krillin arrives on the island with the remote control that bulma gave him and soon locates the androids
even though he knows the importance of carrying out his mission to destroy android 18 he hides behind a mountain conflicted
ever since android 18 kissed krillin on the mountainside road he has developed strong feelings of affection for her and struggles internally against causing her any harm
much to android 18s surprise krillin smashes the remote
back at the lookout piccolo and tien watch the fight
piccolo mentions that vegeta is toying with semiperfect cell and he had the strength to defeat him a long time ago
he believes that decision may come back to haunt him
in the hyperbolic time chamber gohans chances of becoming super saiyan looks bleak
goku then informs him that the transformation to super saiyan comes in response to a need not a desire
future trunks enters the battle
after dominating in battle the ascended vegeta has clearly proven himself superior to semiperfect cell
vegeta then tells cell that he has no chance of winning because even if by some miracle cell managed to defeat him future trunks would have finished him off
for the first time vegeta vocally acknowledges trunks as his son claiming that although future trunks is not as strong as vegeta it would be difficult to tell them apart because of future trunks incredible fighting power
while listening to these words future trunks has a pained look on his face as if he is hiding something
at this point vegeta expresses his disappointment that semiperfect cell did not present enough of a challenge for vegeta to test his new strength against
semiperfect cell now more desperate than ever to absorb android 18 conjures a plan to reach perfection
because he is made up of the cells of vegeta he knows that vegetas greatest weakness is his pride
semiperfect cell then uses that weakness to manipulate vegeta
cell tells him that if he had the chance to reach his perfect form he would become a worthy adversary and he claims that vegeta would be no match for him
vegeta who hungers for a challenge and any chance to prove that he is the best falls for cells trap
he steps back from battle allowing semiperfect cell an open opportunity to absorb android 18 so that he will become a worthy opponent
vegeta kicks future trunks in order to give cell time to absorb android 18
however future trunks knows that his father is blinded by his pride if cell reaches his perfect form his power will greatly surpass vegetas although vegeta does not believe it is possible
semiperfect cell soon finds the androids on the island but future trunks blocks his path stopping him before he can act
this angers vegeta who is eager to prove himself against perfect cell
vegeta then steps in and attacks future trunks hindering his efforts to stop cell
future trunks however is determined to stop cell from transforming at all costs even if it means standing up to vegeta
vegeta laughs at trunks claiming that he does not have the guts to challenge his own father because he is weakened by his feelings
future trunks then proves him wrong conjuring a powerful energy wave and blasting it at vegeta
android 18 is absorbed by semiperfect cell
because of this vegeta realizes that trunks is strongerwilled than he thought and his determination earns vegetas respect
with vegeta temporarily out of the way future trunks krillin and android 16 work to keep cell away from android 18 in an allout attack
however cell eventually uses solar flare blinding everyone so that he can absorb android 18 at long last
to prevent any interference semiperfect cell creates a powerful barrier around himself as he transforms
super saiyan goku firing his super kamehameha
meanwhile in the hyperbolic time chamber gohan has realized that the only way for him to become a super saiyan is for his father to fight him at full power
reluctant goku turns into a super saiyan and prepares to fire a kamehameha at gohan
he does so and gohan is able to hold it off
while blocking it gohan expresses his determination to follow in his fathers footsteps
he recalls the many times when he was in danger and his friends helped him although he was not able to help them in return due to his lack of strength
this rage proves to be the incentive that gohan needed for he feeds off of his rage and transforms into a super saiyan firing the blast back at goku
perfect cell after absorbing android 18
back at the battlefield an enraged krillin attacks perfect cell along with future trunks but the attack has no effect
perfect cell then knocks krillin unconscious with a mere kick
future trunks gives him a senzu bean and krillin tells him that he has never felt such strength and power before
krillin also tells future trunks that he can sense the massive power that trunks is holding back and he asks why he has not unleashed that power to put a stop to cell
future trunks then recalls his training in the hyperbolic time chamber stating that at one point vegeta reached a plateau and trunks was able to surpass him
however trunks does not want his father to know that he surpassed him because he fears that vegeta would then hate him because of it
even though trunks has worked hard to gain his fathers approval he knows that vegeta would rather lose than to accept someones help because of his extreme pride
therefore future trunks refuses to step in and reveal his true power until the moment vegeta loses consciousness
perfect cell then resumes his fight with an unimpressed vegeta
battle for the future
super vegeta preparing to unleash his final flash
at the start of the battle perfect cell toys with vegeta allowing vegeta to believe he actually has a chance to win just as vegeta did to semiperfect cell
perfect cell hides his true power and appears to have only gained speed by dodging all of vegetas attacks
vegeta becomes frustrated which affects his fighting for the worse as he is too blinded by anger to fully concentrate
at one point vegeta charges at cell and kicks him in the neck
this does not faze cell at all which utterly shocks vegeta as he reveals that he put all of his energy into the kick
with only one kick cell sends vegeta flying across the island through several rock formations and into the water
it takes a moment for vegeta to resurface and stand back up
while he is down cell laughs at his apparen't weakness and thanks vegeta for being a good warmup as well as allowing cell to reach perfection however foolish a mistake it was
outraged vegeta flies into the sky and challenges cell to take his next attack headon
he concentrates nearly every ounce of energy he has left into a blast and launches it at cell
perfect cell senses the massive energy vegeta put into his final flash attempting to dodge it at the last second but it destroys his right arm
however he regenerates and then with a short series of attacks knocks vegeta unconscious
200pxfuture trunks ultra ssj
trunks ascends in order to face perfect cell
after perfect cell deals his devastating blows to vegeta future trunks becomes enraged and he transforms into a super saiyan second grade
he then instructs krillin to take vegeta away from the battlefield so that he can recover
because he does not want his father to know that he has surpassed his power future trunks allows cell to take the upper hand as a distraction and does not fight back in defense until vegeta is gone
cell and trunks then begin to fight on practically equal terms as cell has the advantage of speed and trunks has the advantage of strength
perfect cell then encourages future trunks to demonstrate more of his strength leading trunks to transform into a super saiyan third grade
as he gathers his energy piccolo observes him from above in amazement stating that trunks is now even stronger than vegeta and possibly cell as well
future trunks now thought to be the strongest warrior in the universe attempts to attack cell but cell easily dodges every blow
this confuses trunks as he believed his super saiyan third grade powers would be enough to defeat cell
however perfect cell eventually finds the flaw in future trunks transformation explaining that although the form grants him superior strength it heavily incapacitates him in terms of speed
cell knows that he is faster and taunts trunks to charge up his strength even more knowing that it will only debilitate him further
goku tells gohan the limitations of his new form
back in the hyperbolic time chamber goku has discovered the super saiyan second and third grades forms and immediately has discovered it's weakness the bulk of their muscles greatly affects their speed and it would be useless to be so strong if you cannot catch your opponent
goku then comes up with a plan to stay in super saiyan form for so long that it feels natural so they will not have to waste the energy of transforming and sustaining the transformation during battle
that way they can increase their stamina with the energy they saved and balance their strength and speed while preserving their ki
cell announces to trunks the cell games to happen in 10 days
future trunks resumes his fight with perfect cell
perfect cell decides to exploit future trunks weakness
he uses his speed advantage to defeat future trunks who is still wondering why he cannot touch perfect cell
cell tells him why and explains that he could have increased his own strength if he wanted to
realizing his foolish mistake trunks quit's the battle and tells perfect cell that he can kill him
however perfect cell lets him live and is curious about how future trunks and vegeta gained so much power in so little time
this leads him to come up with an idea of having a tournament the cell games which will occur in ten days
the saga begins with cells announcement of the cell games which will be held 10 days after his television broadcast
goku and gohan emerge from the hyperbolic time chamber mastering super saiyan full power
gohans appearance comes as a surprise to the others especially piccolo and chichi as he now has greater muscle mass and is taller than before 
using instant transmission goku visit's cell at the tournament platform in order to gain an understanding of his power
he then transmit's himself back to the lookout where the others are waiting
they ask goku if he thinks he will be able to defeat cell and goku calmly laughs it off claiming that he does not really know and thinks cell will probably beat him into the ground
this comes as a surprise to the others as they do not understand why goku is acting so aloof
piccolo then reminds goku that he and gohan can go back into the hyperbolic time chamber for one more day but goku refuses the offer
once again this comes as a surprise to the others
goku tells them that he and gohan will be training outside of the chamber rather than subject their bodies to any more strain
this agitates vegeta who expresses his anger that goku is always one step ahead of him and he wonders exactly what secret goku is hiding
goku channels his power for korin
goku and gohan then pay a visit to korin and ask if he can determine how gokus power measures up against cell
korin deduces that cell is stronger and goku once again laughs it off claiming that he discovered a great secret while in the hyperbolic time chamber which comes as a surprise to gohan
for the next 9 days most of the dragon team use their time to train though goku and gohan train for only three days and spend the remaining six resting
goku also pays a visit to new namek and asks dende to become the new guardian of earth
eager to see gohan again dende accepts the offer and creates a new shenron capable of granting three wishes though this could be reduced to two if one wish took too much effort
perfect cell effortlessly knocks away mr
satan into a mountain cliff
when the tournament commences goku decides he would be the first one to fight perfect cell
however the world champion mr
satan along with his students in combat caroni and pirozhki attempt to fight perfect cell first though each of them are easily flicked away and disqualified
first caroni attempts to attack cell from high up and cell sent him even higher with his enormous energy
after falling caroni was convinced that cell was tremendously powerful
pirozhki attempts to rush at cell headfirst only to be flicked backward by cells simple energy which seemed too much for pirozhki to handle
satan then attempts to attack cell with a slew of punches and kicks only to be knocked into the mountains
after this throughout the entire tournament mr
satan decides to claim he is suffering from intense stomach pains in order to avoid fighting cell
he also calls the techniques in the ring tricks
goku and perfect cell begin to battle and in a heated display of power technique and ability
to no ones surprise goku seems to be able to keep up against the mechanically engineered monster
goku battles perfect cell
perfect cell pulled out all kinds of tricks performing various moves such as the death beam and kamehameha
goku and perfect cell battled for a while until perfect cell grew tired of being confined to the small ring
so perfect cell destroyed the ring and made the battle an allout fight just to make things more interesting for him with no rules applied
goku threw everything he could at perfect cell and even tricked perfect cell into believing he would destroy the earth with a kamehameha
perfect cell was noticeably afraid as goku powered up the energy blast but goku tricked him by performing instant transmission to teleport directly in front of perfect cell and unleashed the blast on him
the entire top half of perfect cell was disintegrated
the z warriors seemed content until the remains of perfect cell jumped to it's feet and regenerated
goku knew that if he continued the earth would be destroyed or perfect cell and himself would die fighting each other
goku suddenly forfeited the match to perfect cell and surrendered
he reasoned that only one person could defeat perfect cell
when goku revealed his son gohan as his pick to fight the z fighters were furious and perfect cell was amused
before gohan and cell begin to fight goku asked krillin for a senzu bean which he threw to cell surprising everyone
goku explained to the z fighters that cell was worn out from their fight so it would not be fair
krillin argues and even thought that goku got a screw loose or something
cell gladly eats the senzu bean and proceeds with the fight
it took a while for the battle to commence between gohan and perfect cell and even longer for gohan to get serious
as a full power super saiyan he did no better than his father and the z fighters were noticeably worried 
as the battle continued gohan told perfect cell to stop fighting as the power he could harness when he becomes enraged would destroy everything
however this only fueled perfect cells desire to push gohan to the limit much to gohans horror
finally android 16 decided to destroy perfect cell himself with the selfdestruction device in his body
he wrapped his arms around perfect cells torso with the purpose of killing them both
to android 16s surprise krillin informs that the bomb had been removed by bulma when she reprogrammed him earlier during repairs
perfect cell then gained the upper hand and destroyed all of android 16 but his head which rolled over the battlefield
perfect cell even claimed that even if the bomb did blow up he would most likely not be affected too much despite his fearful look when he found out what android 16 was intending to do
the cell juniors attack
perfect cell then created 7 smaller blue versions of himself from his tail and christened them cell juniors
after they were born he ordered them to attack the z fighters but not kill them
was close to the power of perfect cell himself
only vegeta and future trunks in their super saiyan second grade forms and piccolo managed to hold them off for a while but eventually all of them were brutally beaten up 
gohan transforms into a super saiyan 2 after witnessing android 16s death
as gohan watched these maniacal cell jrs heartlessly beat his friends and family he became enraged but it was still not enough
perfect cell noticing gohans anger ordered the cell juniors to kill everyone
at this point hercule discovered the head of android 16 which surprisingly could still talk
android 16 pleaded with hercule to take him near gohan for the sake of the world
hercule complied despite his fear and the androids head landed between gohan and cell
android 16 gave some advice and words of encouragement to gohan saying it was okay to fight sometimes to defend loved ones and to protect the world he loved
perfect cell overhearing this claimed that this was good advice and promptly crushed android 16s head beneath his foot
this was the boiling point when gohan snapped
this enraged gohan to his very limit's and pushed him to a new level super saiyan 2 the super saiyan level ascended beyond a super saiyan 
perfect cell was pleased when gohan reached this form but gohans first action was mercilessly taking down the smaller cell juniors which he defeated in a single hit each
the already astounded z warriors with the exception of goku were amazed as gohan and perfect cell began to battle with gohan dominating the powerful android
cell pumps up when he loses his temper against gohan
even after cell powered up to maximum and punched gohan hard in the face gohan was barely fazed at all
with just two punches gohan almost incapacitated cell completely
perfect cell truly learned fear when gohan began dodging all of his attacks taunting him and overpowering even his strongest kamehameha at point blank range
this almost destroyed cell but gohan decided to let cell suffer for a while which made goku order gohan to kill cell
but it was too late
cell regenerated using piccolos cells
making the same mistake future trunks made earlier he began a transformation that reduced his speed drastically making him unable to hit gohan
after gohan had had enough of dodging cells punches he kicked cell in the face and then in the stomach
the kick to the stomach was hard enough to make cell regurgitate android 18 which made him revert to his semiperfect form
cell returns and immediately murders an unprepared trunks
enraged semiperfect cell threatened to destroy the whole planet and began to selfdestruct
goku decided to step in because if he did not semiperfect cell would have killed himself destroying the planet with him
goku used the instant transmission to reach semiperfect cell and then transmitted them both to king kais planet which was subsequently destroyed along with goku semiperfect cell king kai bubbles and gregory
the z warriors were in anguish over what had transpired and knew goku took his life for the rest of the planet
but to their surprise a strong wind began to blow and a tremendously powerful force came upon them
cell was back a single death beam by cell impaled future trunks and killed him
he came back in his perfect
form due to the fact that his cells stored the memory of his perfect form and he was exponentially stronger than before because his core remained unharmed and from it he had regenerated
he had become a lot stronger thanks to the saiyan cells inside him which after a neardeath experience increased his power dramatically
this power increase brought cell up to a form he calls ultimate perfection
gohan injured after saving vegeta
the previously distraught gohan was in fact pleased to see super perfect cell had returned and hoped to avenge his father
vegeta seeing his own son get killed by super perfect cell became stunned but this soon turned into anger as he went into a berserk rage against super perfect cell
despite everyone telling him that future trunks could be revived by the dragon balls vegeta who went super saiyan attacked super perfect cell mercilessly and attacked him with an array of energy blasts
it was absolutely hopeless however as super perfect cell gave one hit to vegeta that knocked him out and almost killed him
he was about to kill vegeta off with a ki blast but gohan intercepted the blast with his own arm
it became badly damaged and hung limply at his side
vegeta in a rare moment actually apologized to gohan
super perfect cell jumped back and prepared for an attack
super perfect cell kamehameha
super perfect cell prepares his solar kamehameha
super perfect cell fired his solar kamehameha at gohan which is stated by himself to have enough energy to destroy the entire solar system that they reside in
after losing use of one of his arms and seeing how much stronger cell was now gohan seemingly lost all hope of destroying super perfect cell and gave up until he heard goku communicating to him from the other world via king kai
goku encouraged gohan to believe in his power and with newfound hope gohan prepared a onehanded kamehameha
since gohan had used up a lot of energy and only used one arm which had been injured by super perfect cells blast for a kamehameha he was at a disadvantage
this coupled with the fact that super perfect cell was equal to or greater than gohan in power seemed to bring gohan down all the more
gohan unleashes a final kamehameha against cell
the battle between the kamehameha waves proved intense
as tien piccolo vegeta krillin and yamcha watched they begun to doubt gohans power
in a heated battle between gohan and super perfect cell the kamehameha wave grew and grew
even though cell nearly overtook gohan several times gohan was aided by his father during the battle who encouraged him and supported him against super perfect cell
with this encouragement gohan was finally in the right state of mind to put forth his full power which seemingly brought the kamehameha duel to a standstill
everyone but vegeta also assisted him in a foursided attack
the distraction helped gohan push his power even further
but it still was not enough
vegeta caught in his pride ponders over whether to go help gohan or stay on the sidelines
finally vegetas better side brought him to power up to maximum and go help gohan
super perfect cell is obliterated by gohans kamehameha
even though gohan was giving it all of his power super perfect cell begins to take a huge upper hand in the struggle once again which leaves everyone even goku and gohan very worried
cell was about to fully overtake gohan and the earth and everything on it was about to be destroyed when suddenly a surprise galick blazer from vegeta leaves super perfect cell a bit stunned and very distracted
gohan seizes the opportunity encouraged by goku and unleashes all the rest of his strength into the kamehameha wave which overwhelms super perfect cells kamehameha and envelops him in the enormous energy
as super perfect cells body disintegrates it is obvious super perfect cell cannot understand that he has been defeated
his core is the last thing to burn up in the kamehameha and it's destruction marks the moment of super perfect cells death
everyone was exhausted especially gohan who had used up nearly all his energy to defeat super perfect cell
of course despite his extreme fatigue and injuries gohan could only smile as the z fighters looked upon him with pride and as goku told him how proud he was of him
despite his injuries and exhaustion gohan is able to smile after defeating super perfect cell
after the battle ends the heroes made their way to kamis lookout where dende healed gohan and then android 18 who yamcha was scared of
after that gohan told everyone krillin has a crush on android 18
super perfect cell was gone but so was goku
the z warriors attempted to wish him back after wishing all of cells victims back but failed to revive goku because he had already been wished back to life once before and shenron cannot revive a person more than once
however goku decided to stay in other world after explaining that he seems to attract evil people so it would be better for the earth to live in peace without him
he also said that gohan surpassed him greatly now so there would be no worries if another threat came
with the second wish krillin wanted the androids to be wished into people due to his crush on android 18
but shenron could not grant the wish as both androids were stronger than him and he could not change anything about their persons
so krillin instead wished that the bombs inside both of them were removed
this shenron could do with ease

she was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible firebreathing dragon
many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison but none prevailed
she waited in the dragons keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true loves first kiss
 a green hand rips the page out of the book
like thats ever gonna happen
cut to an outhouse exterior
what a load of
the door slams open revealing the man a green ogre
he sees his house built into the bottom of a large tree stump and breathes a happy sigh
he lives a normal life 
he undresses and takes a shower outside
he brushes his teeth 
he smiles into the mirror 
he jumps into a pond 
some dead fish float up and he grabs one
after he gets dressed he gets a giant slug out of a hollow log 
finally he paints a beware
sign and posts it
men burst out of a tavern in the town and plan to capture the ogre for a reward
they grab pitchforks and torches and head for his place
the ogre is eating a bowl of eyeballs
he burps to light his fireplace swallows the fish and then relaxes in his easy chair
the men finally arrive at the ogres house at night
the ogre hears them and sneaks up behind them
he frightens them by telling them what he could do to them then he roars and they all flee in fear
the ogre sees a poster on the ground and picks it up wanted
he tosses it back on the ground and walks away
in the forest various fairy tale creatures are being loaded into wagons for the rewards the seven dwarfs a witch an elf pinocchio the three bears tinker bell etc
a talking donkey is next in line after pinocchio 
the captain of the guards gives gepetto five shillings for the possessed toy
the donkeys owner can't get him to talk when asked by the knights so they drag her away
as she struggles with the knights she kicks the lantern holding tinker bell and it flies into the air landing on the donkey and spilling pixie dust on him
he floats into the air
the donkey talks now as he floats away saying you might have seen a house fly maybe even a super fly but i bet you aint never seen a donkey fly
peter pan and the three little pigs are surprised that he can fly but the captain of the guards is more surprised that he can talk
the pixie dust wears off and the donkey falls to the ground
the knights try to seize him but he runs into the forest
the donkey bumps into the back of the ogre who was posting a keep out
poster on a tree
when the knights approach the donkey hides behind the ogre
the captain of the guards announces that lord farquaad authorized him to arrest them and transport them to a designated resettlement facility
the ogre says oh really
you and what army
the captain looks back and sees that the other knights have run away so he too runs away yelling in fear
as the ogre walks away the donkey follows him and compliments him on how great he was with the guards
the donkey says that he dosen't have any friends and asks to stay with the ogre who then tries to scare him away
the donkey just gives him a compliment on how scary that was and sings
the ogre tells the donkey that he is an ogre but the donkey dosen't care
the donkey asks for the ogres name and he replies shrek
shrek lets the donkey stay at his house for one night 
as shrek eats his dinner he hears a noise and shouts at the donkey to stay outside
he looks back at his table and sees the three blind mice 
when he grabs the mice the seven dwarfs push the case with snow white onto the table
they tell shrek it's because the beds taken and shrek sees that the big bad wolf is in it
he grabs the wolf and tosses him out but sees hundreds of fairy tale creatures camped outside his house
pinocchio and one of the pigs tell shrek that lord farquaad evicted them and put them there
the donkey tells shrek that he knows where lord farquaad is so shrek announces that their welcome is worn out that he will see farquaad right now so that he can get them all off his swamp and back where they all came from
shrek tells the donkey that he is coming with him
the donkey is happy and says shrek and donkey on a whirlwind big city adventure
donkey then starts singing on the road again but shrek makes him hum it instead
in a castle the towns lord walks down a hallway
when he reaches the guards at the end it's obvious that he is a dwarf
he enters the torture chamber where the executioner thelonius is drowning the gingerbread man in a glass of milk
the lord torments the gingerbread man and then crumbles one of his severed legs
he tells the gingerbread man that he and all the other fairy tale trash are monsters that are poisoning his perfect world
he demands that the gingerbread man tell him where the others are and starts to tear off one of his gumdrop buttons
the gingerbread man then rambles on about the muffin man but they are interrupted by knights who bring in the evil queens magic mirror
the lord knocks the gingerbread man into a trash can then asks mirror mirror on the wall is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all
the magic mirror replies that he is not technically a king yet but can become one by marrying a princess
the magic mirror then presents the eligible bachelorettes dating game
style cinderella snow white and princess fiona 
upon prompting by thelonius lord farquaad picks princess fiona
the magic mirror then displays princess fiona while playing escape 
lord farquaad says that shes perfect and that finally he will be the perfect king
the magic mirror tries to tell him what happens at night after sunset but he tells the mirror to be quiet
lord farquaad then announces that they are going to have a tournament
shrek and donkey reach the castle at duloc
the parking lot is arranged like the one at disneyland
shrek remarks that it must be lord farquaads castle
it's extremely tall and shrek jokes that he could be compensating for something
as they approach the roped lines for the ticket booth shrek tries to talk to dulocs costumed mascot which looks like lord farquaad but he runs away in fear through the lines
shrek walks straight through the ropes dragging them along as donkey follows and tries to calm the mascot down
the mascot gets knocked out when he runs into the turnstile
shrek and donkey go through the turnstile
elevator music plays in the otherwise quiet and deserted courtyard
the souvenir shop only has lord farquaad items
donkey sees an information booth and pulls the lever
there is some clicking and then the doors open revealing music and wooden puppets that sing the rules for duloc a perfect place
the doors shut and a camera takes shrek and donkeys picture then their photo comes out showing them stunned
shrek and donkey hear fanfare and go in that direction
lord farquaad is high upon a balcony announcing that the tournament winner will have the privilege to go rescue princess fiona
shrek and donkey march past the contestants then farquaad instead tells the knights that the one who kills the ogre will be named champion
shrek bursts open a wine barrel to slip up some knights then slides through the brew swinging at them with one of their axes like a hockey player
donkey climbs onto the other barrel and rolls over some more knights
when more knights arrive shrek jumps into a corral and fights them like a professional wrestler
after a while the crowd cheers for shrek
donkey joins in tag team
style knocking out another knight
after shrek sit's on another knight a woman shouts for shrek to give give him the chair so he whacks him over the head with a chair
after shrek throws the last knight donkey kicks him knocking him out
shrek hams it up for the crowd
lord farquaad signals to the knights with crossbows but instead of giving the order to kill shrek he proclaims that shrek is the champion
farquaad tells shrek that he won the honor to go on the quest
shrek replies that he is already on a quest to get his swamp back where farquaad dumped the fairy tale creatures
farquaad offers a deal to shrek that if he goes on this quest farquaad will give him his swamp back with the squatters gone so shrek agrees
on the way to rescue princess fiona shrek and donkey pass through various vegetable fields
as shrek munches on some vegetables donkey asks shrek why hes going to fight a dragon and rescue a princess to get his swamp back which farquaad filled with freaks
he tells shrek that he should act like an ogre and lay siege to his fortress and grind his bones
shrek sarcastically suggests that instead he could have decapitated some villagers and drank their fluids
shrek tells donkey that theres a lot more to ogres than people think that they are like onions and have layers
shrek and donkey pass a rundown windmill
after two days they finally reach the castle where princess fiona is held up on a mountain
dried lava and brimstone are everywhere
donkey thinks the smell is from shrek but shrek tells donkey that if it were him donkey would be dead
they reach a footbridge over a river of lava leading to the castle
donkey is afraid to cross but shrek backs him up tricking him to cross
inside the castle shrek tells donkey to look for stairs so they can reach princess fiona
shrek puts on some armor of a dead knight
suddenly the dragon breathes fire and chases after donkey
shrek grabs the dragons tail but it shakes him off sending him flying into princess fionas room and waking her up
meanwhile the dragon has donkey trapped
donkey complements it on it's white teeth notices that it's a girl dragon and gives it more appropriate compliments
the dragon picks him up with her teeth and walks happily away
while shrek recovers princess fiona lies back down on the bed and pretends to sleep
shrek approaches her but instead of kissing her he shakes her forcefully and shouts for her to wake up
princess fiona wants romance but shrek keeps his helmet on and drags her down the stairs
down below the dragon is cuddling and romancing donkey
shrek grabs a hanging chain and swings towards the dragon but the chain is stuck up above
he shakes it loose and he falls knocking donkey away as the dragon is about to kiss him
the dragon kisses shreks naked butt
the chains frame falls around the dragons neck like a collar
shrek and donkey run away then shrek grabs donkey and fiona as the dragon chases them repeatedly breathing fire
they crisscross the castle and the chain tangles around all the pillars
shrek locks the chain into the floor with a sword
as they run across the bridge the dragon burns half of it up but they make it safely across
the dragon tries to fly after them but the chain holds it back
safely on the other side fiona demands that shrek remove his helmet and kiss her
he removes his helmet and she is shocked and disappointed that he is an ogre
shrek tells her that lord farquaad sent him that hes the one who wants to marry her
princess fiona tells him in that case that lord farquaad should rescue her and she refuses to leave
shrek picks her up then they head back to duloc
when shrek finally sets fiona down she asks shrek and donkey what duloc and lord farquaad are like
shrek and donkey start making short jokes about him
she says that they are just jealous of him
when she hears that they will get to duloc the next day fiona gets upset and insists that they make camp immediately
they find a rock cliff and princess fiona sleeps alone in a small enclosure on it
shrek tells donkey stories about the stars and then says that things are more than they appear
donkey wonders what they will do when they get back to their swamp but shrek tells him that it's his swamp and he is going to build a tenfoot wall around his land
donkey thinks that shrek is trying to keep people out then shrek shouts at donkey that hes trying to keep everyone out
fiona wakes up and slides the door open then overhears shrek telling donkey how people judge him before they even know him and thats why hes better off alone
fiona closes the door then donkey and shrek talk about the stars again
at his castle lord farquaad is in bed with a drink and repeatedly makes the magic mirror show him the picture of princess fiona
he says that shes perfect
the next morning princess fiona sings with a bird but it explodes when she hit's a high note
she cooks the birds eggs for breakfast
fiona tells shrek and donkey that she is making it up to them because they got off to a bad start yesterday after all they rescued her
as they walk towards duloc shrek burps then fiona burps too
suddenly a man swinging from a vine grabs fiona
he calls out for his merry men
they all appear dancing and singing about him robin hood
as he brandishes a knife robin hood finishes the song by saying he will cut out shreks heart but fiona swings down and knocks him into a boulder
she defeats the merry men with kung fu mixed with the matrix
shrek and donkey are amazed
shrek asks fiona where she learned that and she replies that when one lives alone one has to learn these things
she sees that theres an arrow in shreks butt
donkey starts panicking so fiona sends him off looking for a blue flower with red thorns
when fiona tries to pull out the arrow from shreks butt he squirms falls to the ground and fiona lands on him just as donkey returns with the flower
donkey gets mad because he thinks they just wanted to be alone
when fiona pulls out the arrow donkey sees the blood and faints
shrek picks him up and they head back to duloc
in a field princess fiona grabs a spiders web and gathers up the flying bugs bothering shrek giving it to him who eats it like cotton candy
shrek catches a frog and inflates it like a balloon handing it to fiona
fiona grabs a snake off a tree branch and inflates it like a balloon and gives it to shrek
they push each other playfully then run off together and their balloons float away into the air
they finally reach the windmill and see duloc in the distance
shrek shrugs and tells princess fiona that her future await's her and shes surprised to see duloc
donkey interrupts and tells fiona that shrek thinks lord farquaad is compensating for something
donkey starts to say that it means farquaad has a really
shrek knocks him down a little too hard and then tells fiona that they should move on and starts walking
fiona tells shrek that shes worried about donkey that he dosen't look so good
shrek comes over and plays along with her pretense and says that he looks awful
fiona tells donkey that shell make him some tea
donkey then acts like a hypochondriac
shrek and fiona go to find dinner and firewood
fiona likes the food shrek cooked saying that it's delicious
she sighs then looks at duloc and says that shell be eating differently tomorrow night
he hopes that she will visit him in the swamp because hell cook for her
she says that she would like that and then they smile and look at each other
shrek begins to ask fiona something important but changes his mind and asks for the rest of her food
they lean towards each other about to kiss
donkey butts in saying that the sunset is romantic
fiona jumps up panicking
she pretends to be afraid of the dark and donkey tells her that he is afraid of the dark too
fiona goes into the windmill to sleep by herself glancing back briefly at shrek
donkey tells shrek that he can tell with his animal instincts that shrek and fiona were digging on each other
and says that shrek should tell fiona how he feels about her
shrek tries to deny that he likes her and then dejectedly says that fiona is a princess and he is an ogre
he walks off and tells donkey that hes getting more firewood but donkey sees that theres still a large pile of firewood there
shrek sit's alone by a field of sunflowers staring at duloc until night
donkey afraid to be alone by himself in the dark goes inside the windmill looking for princess fiona
a large green hand grabs the ladder and then a female ogre looks down on donkey as he wanders around
all the sights and sounds frighten donkey
the ogre falls through the wood and screams as she lands on the floor frightening donkey even more
hes terrified when she stands up and he screams for shrek
donkey asks her what she did with the princess
she tries to calm and quiet him down saying that it's her in this body
he thinks that she ate the princess and shouts at her stomach then calls for shrek again
she finally calms him down and convinces him that she is the princess
he wonders what happened to her telling her that shes
she admit's that shes ugly
donkey thinks it's because she ate the weed rat but she tells him that shes been this way as long as she can remember
she says that it only happens when the sun goes down
she looks at her reflection in a barrel of water and recites a spell by night one way by day another
this shall be the norm until you find loves first kiss and then take loves true form
she tells donkey that when she was a little girl a witch cast a spell on her every night she becomes this this horrible ugly beast she was placed in a tower to await the day her true love would rescue her
fiona sit's down and tells donkey that it's why she has to marry farquaad tomorrow before the suns sets and he sees her like this
she cries and then donkey tries to console her
he says that shes ugly but adds that she only looks like this at night and that shrek is ugly all the time
she replies that shes a princess and it's not how a princess should look
donkey suggests that she shouldn't marry farquaad
she insists that she has to because only her true loves first kiss can break the spell
donkey tells her that shes an ogre and shreks an ogre and that they have a lot in common
shrek walks back to the windmill holding a sunflower
hes rehearsing what he will say to princess fiona when he gives it to her
when he climbs the steps of the windmill he overhears fiona telling donkey that she just can't marry whomever she wants and to take a good look at her
she asks donkey who could ever love a beast so hideous and ugly princess and ugly don't go together
thats why i can't stay here with shrek
my only chance to live happily ever after is to marry my true love
she tells donkey that it's just how it should be
shrek becomes disheartened because he thinks fiona was calling him ugly and then throws the sunflower down and storms off towards duloc
fiona tells donkey that it's the only way to break the spell
he tells her that she has to tell shrek the truth and starts to leave but she says that no one must ever know and makes donkey promise not to tell anyone
donkey says that she should tell shrek then goes outside
fiona opens the door and looks around but only sees the sunflower and takes it inside
donkey looks around then sleeps by the campfire
in the morning princess fiona picks off the petals of the sunflower reciting the he loves me he loves me not
game but instead saying i tell him i tell him not
she pulls off the last petal excited that she should tell shrek about her spell
she opens the door and calls for him but only sees donkey outside snoring
the sun rises and she transforms back to human form
shrek walks up and she rushes to greet him but he angrily walks past her and sit's on the steps
she says that she has to tell him something but he replies that he heard everything she said last night
she says that she thought he would understand
he says he understands quoting her asking who could ever love a hideous ugly beast
she says that she thought it wouldn't matter to him but he says that it does
a horse whinnies and they turn around
fanfare announces lord farquaads arrival as he rides towards them accompanied by some knights then donkey wakes up
farquaad greets princess fiona and then shrek demands that farquaad give him the deed to his swamp as promised
farquaad tells shrek that the swamp is cleared out as agreed then tells him to take the deed and go before he changes his mind
shrek grabs the deed and stands aside
farquaad calls fiona beautiful
she tells him that she was just saying a short farewell just as a knight sets him on the ground
farquaad says that it's sweet that she dosen't have to waste good manners on the ogre it dosen't have feelings
fiona agrees that it
farquaad grabs her hand and proposes to her
she looks at shrek who is staring at his deed then accepts
farquaad jumps up happily and tells her that hell make plans for them to marry tomorrow
she stops him and says that they should get married today before the sun sets
shrek angrily walks back to his swamp
farquaad agrees that they should get married today and talks about all the things to prepare
they both get on the horse and head to duloc and then fiona tells shrek faretheewell
donkey tries to stop shrek and says that theres something he dosen't know about fiona
shrek shouts at donkey that he heard what they said last
he tells donkey that since he and fiona are great friends donkey should follow her home
donkey replies that he wants to go with shrek
shrek continues shouting at donkey that he lives alone in his swamp not with anyone else especially useless pathetic annoying talking donkeys
shrek storms off to his swamp
 at his swamp shrek sees that the fairy tale creatures are gone only their tents remain along with some debris
he sighs heavily and walks back to his house
donkey walks through the forest sadly glancing back
shrek sees his reflection in a puddle of water and then sadly lowers his head
princess fiona in her wedding gown looks sadly out the window
shrek looks sadly out his window then angrily takes a sunflower off the table and throws it into the fireplace
fiona sadly looks at herself again in the mirror
farquaad looks at himself in the magic mirror which smiles only when hes looking at it
fiona looks at the wedding cake and pushes the figurine of farquaad down to it's proper height
she turns around and quizzically looks at the suit of armor
at the same spot in his house shrek leans sadly against the table and stares at the fireplace
donkey drinks from a pond by the forest then is startled when he hears and sees the dragon crying they console each other
shrek is alone and tries to eat at his table fiona is alone and tries to eat at her table they both put their faces in their hands
shrek hears a thumping sound outside and opens the door to see donkey putting branches on the ground
donkey tells him that it's a wall
shrek tells him that a wall should go around his swamp
donkey replies that it does go around his half of the swamp and that donkey gets the other half
donkey tells shrek that he earned half of the swamp because he did half of the work rescuing the princess
they argue over ownership of the swamp
shrek gives up and walks away saying that hes done with donkey then donkey chases after him
donkey says that shrek just thinks about himself hes mean to donkey insults him dosen't appreciate him and pushes him around or away
shrek asks donkey that if he treated him so bad why did he come back donkey replies that it's what friends do they forgive each other
shrek agrees and then he shouts that he forgives donkey for stabbing him in the back
shrek goes into the outhouse and slams the door
donkey tells shrek that hes so wrapped up like onion layers in his feelings
shrek tells donkey to go away but he tells shrek that hes doing it again
like he did to fiona all she ever did was love him
shrek replies that he heard their conversation that she called him ugly a hideous creature
donkey tells him that she wasnt talking about him but was talking about somebody else
shrek comes out and asks who she was talking about
donkey refuses to tell him because shrek dosen't listen to him
shrek apologizes and admit's that he is just a big stupid ugly ogre
donkey forgives him because thats what friends are for
shrek wonders what fiona said about him but donkey tells him to ask her
shrek cries out that they won't make the wedding in time
donkey whistles and the dragon flies down
shrek climbs the chain up then the dragon puts donkey up too
they fly away to duloc
at the castle the bishop is marrying princess fiona and lord farquaad
thelonius holds the rings
two men hold up cue cards for the audiences appropriate response
fiona interrupts and asks the bishop to skip to the i dos
farquaad chuckles and tells the bishop to continue
the dragon lands outside and then the knights run away fearfully
shrek goes to the door of the church but donkey tells him to wait until the preacher says speak now or forever hold your peace then for shrek to say i object
shrek says that he dosen't have time for this but donkey replies that chicks like romance
they go to the side of the church and shrek repeatedly throws donkey up to look through a window
donkey tells shrek that they are already married
shrek bursts into the church just before farquaad and fiona kiss shouting that he objects
fiona and farquaad are annoyed to see him
shrek wants to talk to fiona but she says that it's too late and tries to kiss farquaad
shrek grabs her hand and tells her that farquaad only wants to marry her so that he can be king then tells her that farquaad is not her true love
fiona asks him what he knows about true love
shrek stammers and farquaad laughs because shrek loves the princess
farquaad cues the laughter
fiona asks shrek if it's true but farquaad grabs her hand and insists that she kiss him now
fiona looks at the setting sun and recalls her spell
she walks to the window and tells shrek that she wanted to show this to him before
she transforms into an ogre and then grins sheepishly at shrek
as for shrek he can only casually note that her state explains a lot about her recent behaviour
the audience is shocked
farquaad sees fiona and says that it
is disgusting and orders his guards to get it
out of his sight to get them both
as shrek and fiona try to reach each other farquaad declares that the marriage is still binding that he is still king and puts on the crown
as guards drag shrek away farquaad tells that hell beg for death
he then tells fiona that hell lock her back in that tower for the rest of her life
shrek frees one of his hands and whistles
the dragon bursts through the large stained glass window with donkey on top and swallows farquaad killing him then burps out his crown
shrek tells fiona that he loves her and she tells him that he loves him too
they kiss and then fiona begins her transformation as her voiceover recounts the rest of the spell
she rises up into the air glowing
bright light radiates from her then a shock wave from her shatters all the windows in the church except one 
fiona completes her transformation and then returns to the floor and collapses
shrek helps fiona up
shes still an ogre and tells shrek that she dosen't understand that shes supposed to be beautiful
shrek tells her that she is beautiful and they kiss again
at the swamp shrek and fiona get married with donkey and all the fairy tale creatures as guests
the wedding song is im a believer by smash mouth
one of the fairy godmothers transforms the three blind mice into horses and a garlic bulb into a carriage and then shrek and fiona leave in the carriage
donkey takes over the song with the others singing and dancing
the wedding celebration continues while shrek and fiona ride away into the sunset
the fairy tale ends with and they lived ugly ever after
the book closes revealing the fairy tale to be shrek and the song ends

youre won the honor of embarking on a great 
quest im already in a quest a quest to get my swamp back
yeah my swamp where you dumped those tale creatures
i'll make you a deal
go on this quest for 
me and i'll give you your swamp back
exactly the way it was
down to the last slimecovered toadstool
as good as gone
what kind of quest
let me get this straight
youre gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a 
princess just so farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only 
don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place
is that about right
maybe theres a good reason donkeys shouldn't talk
i don't get it
why don't you just pull some of that orge stuff on 
him throttle him lay siege to his fortress grinds his bones to make 
your bread the whole orge trip
oh i know what
maybe i could have decapitated an entire village and 
put their heads on a pike gotten a knife cut open their spleen and 
does that sound good to you
uh no not really no
for your information theres a lot more to orges than people think
example okay um orges are like onions
they make you cry
you leave them in the sun they get all brown start sproutin little 
no layers onions have layers
orges have layers onions have 
you get it we both have layers
oh you both have layers
 you know not everybody likes 
cake everybody loves cakes cakes have layers
orges are not like cakes
you know what else everybody likes parfait's
have you ever met a 
person you say lets get some parfait
they say no i don't like 
no parfait parfait's are delicious
no you dense irritating miniature beast of burden orges are like 
onions and of story
parfait's may be the most delicious thing on the whole damn planet
you know i think i preferred your humming
do you have a tissure or 
something im making a mess
just the word parfait make me start 
im on my way from misery to happiness today
im on my way from misery to happiness today
and everything that you receive up yonder
is what you give to me the day i wander
im on my way 
im on my way 
im on my way 
ohh shrek did you do that
you gotta warn somebody before you just crack one off
my mouth was 
believe me donkey if it was me youd be dead
brimstone we must be getting close
don't be talking about it's the brimstone
know what i smell
it wasnt no brimstone
it didn't come off no stone 
sure it's big enough but look at the location
uh shrek uh remember when you said orges have layers
well i have a bit of a confession to make
donkeys don't have 
we wear our fear right out there on our sleeves
donkeys don't have sleeves
you know what i mean
you can't tell me youre afraid of heights
im just a little uncomfortable about being on a rickety bridge over 
a boiling like of lava
im right here beside ya okay for emotional 
support well just tackle this thing together one little baby step 
okay that makes me feel so much better
and don't look down
okay don't look down
shrek im lookin down oh god i can't do this just let me off 
but youre already halfway
but i know that half is safe
i don't have time for this
just donkey lets have a dance then shall me
yes yes do it
no shrek no stop it
you said do it im doin it
shrek im gonna die
so where is this firebreathing painintheneck anyway
inside waiting for us to rescue her
i was talkin about the dragon shrek
cause theres nothin wrong with bein afraid
fears a sensible 
response to an unfamiliar situation
unfamiliar dangerous situation i 
with a dragon that breathes fire and eats knights and 
breathes fire it sure dosen't mean youre a coward if youre a little 
i sure as heck aint no coward
donkey two things okay shut 
now go over there and see if 
you can find any stairs
stairs i thought we was lookin for the princess
the princess will be up the stairs in the highest room in the tallest 
what makes you think shell be there
i read it in a book once
you handle the dragon
i'll handle the stairs
i'll find those 
i'll whip their butt too
those stairs won't know which way 
im gonna take drastic steps
kick it to the curb
don't mess with 
im the stair master
ive mastered the stairs
i wish i had a 
id step all over it
well at least we know where the princess is but wheres the 
oh what large teeth you have
i mean white sparkling teeth
i know you probably hear this all time 
from your food but you must bleach cause that is one dazzling smile 
do i detect a hint of minty freshness and you know 
what else youre youre a girl dragon oh sure i mean of 
course youre a girl dragon
youre just reeking of feminine beauty
whats the matter with you you got something in your eye ohh
man id really love to stay but you know im uh 
im an asthmatic and i don't know if itd work out if youre gonna 
no shrek shrek shrek
are you princess fiona
i am awaiting a knight so bold as to rescue me
but wait sir knight
this beith our first meeting
should it not be 
a wonderful romantic moment
what are you doing you should sweep me off my feet out 
yonder window and down a rope onto your valiant steed
youve had a lot of time to plan this havent you
but we have to savor this moment you could recite an epic poem for 
a ballad a sonnet a limerick or something
i don't think so
can i at least know the name of my champion
i pray that you take this favor as a token of my gratitude
you didn't slay the dragon
it's on my todo list
but this isnt right you were meant to charge in sword drawn 
thats what all the other knights did
yeah right before they burst into flame
thats not the point
where are you going the nexts over there
well i have to save my ass
what kind of knight are you
one of a kind
slow down baby please
i believe it's healthy to get to 
know someone over a long perriod of time
just call me oldfashioned
i don't want to rush into a physical relationship
emotionally ready for a commitment of uh this magnitude really 
is the word im looking for
magnitude hey that is unwanted 
hey what are you doing okay okay
lets just back 
up a little and take this one step at a time
we really should get to 
know each other first as friends or pen pals
im on the road a lot 
but i just love receiving cards id really love to stay but 
don't do that thats my tail thats my personal tail
i don't give permission what are you gonna do with 
no no no no no
yeah it's getting him to shut up thats the trick
okay you two heard for the exit i'll take care of the dragon
you rescued me youre amazing
a little unorthodox i'll admit
but they deed is great and 
thine heart is pure
i am eternally in your debt
and where would a brave knight be without his noble steed
i hope you heard that
she called me a noble steed
she think im a 
the battle is won
you may remove your helmet good sir knight
i have helmet hair
i wouldst look upon the face of my rescuer
no no you wouldn't st
but how will you kiss me
what that wasnt in the job description
maybe it's a perk
oh you must know how it goes
a princess locked in 
a tower and beset by a dragon is rescued by a brave knight and then 
they share true loves first kiss
hmm with shrek you think wait
you think that shrek is you 
you think shrek is your true love
what is so funny
lets just say im not your tipe okay
of course you are
now now remove your 
i really don't think this is a good idea
just take off the helmet
im not going to
you youre a an orge
oh you were expecting prince charming
this is all wrong
youre not supposed 
to be an orge
princess i was sent to rescue you by lord farquaad okay he is the 
one who wants to marry you
then why didn't he come rescue me
you should ask him that when we get there
but i have to be rescued by my true love not by some prge and his 
so much for noble steed
youre not making my job any easier
im sorry but your job is not my problem
you can tell lord farquaad 
that if he wants to rescue me properly i'll be waiting for him right 
hey im no ones messenger boy all right im a delivery boy
im right behind ya
put me down or you will suffer the consequences this is not 
dignified put me down
okay so heres another question
say theres a woman that digs you 
right but you don't really like her that way
how do you let her down 
real easy so her feelings aren't hurt but you don't get burned to a 
you just tell her shes not your true love
everyone knowest what 
happens when you find your hey
the sooner we get to duloc the better
youre gonna love it there princess
and what of my groomtobe lord farquaad whats he like
let me put it this way princess
men of farquaads stature are in 
there are those who think little of him
stop it both of you
youre just jealous you can never 
measure up to a great ruler like lord farquaad
yeah well maybe youre right princess
but i'll let you do the 
when you see him tomorrow
tomorrow itll take that long shouldn't we stop to make camp
no thatll take longer
we can keep going
but theres robbers in the woods
whoa time out shrek campings starting to sound good
im scarier than anything were going to see in this 
i need to find somewhere to camp now
shrek we can do better than that
i don't think this is fit for a 
no no it's perfect
it just needs a few homey touches
homey touches like what
a door well gentlemen i bid thee good night
you want me to read you a bedtime story i will
i said good night
shrek what are you doing
i just you know oh come on
i was just kidding

hey can you tell my future from these stars
the stars don't tell the future donkey
theres bloodnut the flatulent

i know youre making this up
there he is and theres the group of hunters running away

theres just me and my 
the first thing im gonna do is build a tenfoot wall arond my

the minor fall the major lift
the baffled king composing hallelujah
baby ive been here before
i know this room ive walked this floor
i used to live alone before i knew you
ive seen your flag on the marble arch
but love is not a victory march
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah
and all i ever learned from love
is how to shoot at someone
and it's not a cry you can hear at night
it's not somebody whos seen the light
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah
what are you doing
i would think of all people you would recognize a wall when you see 
but the walls supposed to go around my swamp not 
it is around your half

i couldn't leave her if i tried
then i saw her face
now im a believer 
of doubt in my mind
im a believer
